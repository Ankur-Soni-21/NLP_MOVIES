Original title: Aku wa sonzai shinai

Genre: Drama, Environmental

Director: Ryûsuke Hamaguchi

Writers: Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, Eiko Ishibashi

Stars: Hitoshi Omika, Ryô Nishikawa, Ryûji Kosaka
Plot: Takumi and his daughter Hana live a peaceful life in Mizubiki Village, not far from Tokyo. Their tranquility is disrupted when the village learns of plans to construct a glamping site near Takumi’s home, catering to urban dwellers seeking a luxurious retreat in nature. As the community reacts to this encroachment, tensions arise between the local way of life and the desires of the city residents.
* * *
Takumi!
Sorry I’m late!
It’s OK.
Lunchtime was busy.
Busy’s good.
Are these ready?
Yep.
Was that near?
Nah, I heard they’re hunting in Kurihara.
Pretty far then.
Kazuo.
Wild wasabi.
Wild wasabi…
Strong flavor.
Locals eat it with soba noodles. Udon noodles too.
I’ll try adding it to one of our dishes.
Go pick some. I’ll carry the water.
Thanks.
Kazuo!
I remembered I’m late to pick up my kid.
No worries. See you at seven tonight!
For what?




To discuss the glamping project.
Almost forgot! See you then.
Takumi, you’re so forgetful!
My bad.
See you!
Green light, red light.
Sorry I’m late.
Where’s Hana?
She said you’d forget so she walked home.
Green light, red light.
Sorry about that.
Careful, I’m backing up.
Come on. Out of the way.
The car’s coming.
Where’s your bag, Hana?
At daycare.
Hey!
Oak.
Pine.
That’s a larch.
Really?
Larches have black bark. Pine bark is red.
What’s that?
Mountain cherry.
Mountain cherry?




This one’s young.
There’s a big one there.
Oak.
That’s right.
Dogwood.
That one?
Pine!
Correct.
Pines are red, larches are black.
Yep.
This is…
Don’t touch it. It’s Siberian ginseng.
It has thorns.
Even deer don’t eat its berries.
Are they tasty?
Well, they’re a bit too hard for people.
But they can be made into a drink like wine.
You’re not into that.
Bite marks from deer.
Redvein maple?
Yep.
See them here and there?
Looks like cucumber. I bet it’s tasty.
Look, deer tracks.
A fawn.




It was gut shot.
Wounded by a bullet.
It’s their watering hole.
Mr. Suruga will love this.
Wow.
It’s in two days? So soon.
They showed up out of nowhere yesterday.
They want a small audience.
I reached out to a bunch of people though.
How were they?
The lady who came to me seemed nice.
The company’s actually a talent agency.
So it’s for company retreats?
I think this company’s after pandemic subsidies.
Subsidies?
Nowadays, you get paid just for submitting a project plan.
Well, let’s hear them out first.
It’s just a formality though.
Don’t get into needless fights, Tatsu.
Thanks for the wasabi tip.
It’s nothing.
We’re adding it to our seasonal dish.
Great.
I’ll try it soon.
Please do.




New dish?
Yeah, wild wasabi was his idea.
It’s great. It used to be a noodle shop staple.
I can’t wait.
Just remembered.
Mr. Suruga.
Yeah?
Check it out.
Wow.
What’s it from?
Some kind of pheasant, right?
Yep.
You can use it?
Sure.
Quills are used for instruments.
My son plays the harpsichord.
What kind of instrument is that?
Like a piano.
You see the shaft here?
You pluck the strings with this to make sounds.
Get it?
You play the piano?
No, not me.
Thanks for this, Takumi.
My son will love this.
See you!
Bye-bye.
See you at the briefing.
Yep.
See you.
Good night.
Hana.
You’ll get sick.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for joining us on such short notice.
I’m Takahashi from Playmode.
And I’m Mayuzumi.
We plan to operate a glamping site here. It’s set to begin construction in May.
Thank you for coming.
We would like to show you the concept behind it.
We have prepared a video for you to watch.
Takahashi will share further details after the video.
It will be followed by a Q&A session.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Let us begin.
Glamping in Harasawa
Some of you may be unfamiliar with the word “glamping.”
It derives its name from the concept of glamorous camping.
A luxurious outdoor experience awaits at Harasawa.
We hope the site will be loved by visitors




as well as the local community.
Alright.
That’s all from us.
Now for your questions and opinions.
Does anyone here have any questions?
Please pass this on.
So much doesn’t make sense.
OK…
The site can handle up to 64 people. Why’s the septic tank capacity for 50?
It’s based on site area and a projected average occupancy rate of 45% to 55%
We think it’s adequate.
But numbers will vary by season.
As a business, you’re aiming for full occupancy, correct?
Right.
Then that should be the benchmark.
Well, we’re striving to optimize operations to provide top-notch service for everyone.
But you raise a valid point. We will take it into account.
“Optimize”? That’s just for your own benefit.
No, that is not the case.
Yes, please go ahead.
Can you show us the septic tank blueprint again?
Sure.
If you drain from that spot,
it’ll pollute wells downstream.
Wells?
You can’t put the tank there.
Thank you for the feedback.
We spoke to authorities.
We were given some limitations on drainage locations.
So we’ll select the spot that. Impacts the region least.
You can’t put it there.
Wells connect to groundwater.
It’s the water supply for us and communities downstream.
To reduce the impact on our region, put the tank in the center.
Or build a reservoir on-site.
I’m not qualified to respond to that.
The location was determined by surveyors and experts.
How efficient is your septic tank?
Let’s see…
One moment.
It can purify 90% of the water used by 50 people.
So five people’s worth of sewage will go into wells each day?
Yes, if we run at full capacity.
But you are planning to run at full capacity as a business.
Yes, but think about this. The population here is 6,000.
Five people’s worth of sewage is within the safety margin.
That’s not for you to decide.
May I?
Go ahead.
Um, I’m Sachi Minemura. I run an udon restaurant nearby.




I ran a restaurant in Tokyo.
When I tried the soba here, I realized water makes a big difference.
So I moved here four years ago.
I’m not sure I can call myself a local since I’m not originally from here.
I’m sitting on this side, but my position is similar to yours.
I’m able to run my restaurant thanks to help from the community.
Personally, your actions will turn my world upside-down.
It will rob me of my purpose for being here.
But I’m not here to talk about myself.
Even in my short time here, I could feel how important water is to these people.
When I tell them I use spring water for my udon, they commend me.
They look so proud and happy.
You need to understand that the very essence of this village is at stake.
So please proceed with care. Hear everyone out.
As a resident, I ask that you reconsider the septic tank’s location.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Your valuable input will be considered.
Considered? By who?
Our company president. He has the last word.
Why the heck isn’t he here?
She and I were placed in charge.
But you’re a talent agency.
That’s right.
So what do you know?
We’re not experts, but a consulting firm well-versed in glamping is advising us.
Why isn’t your consultant here then?
Our schedules didn’t match up.
You chose this date.
We’ll consider it.
It’s like talking to a wall.
Now, let’s not get emotional here.
What?
You need to be aware that this facility will benefit the entire community.
Glamping draws in tourists. People from Tokyo will come here.
It will become a new tourist hotspot.
The shops here can generate more sales.
Maybe the visitors will stop by your udon restaurant.
More people means better business.
It’ll invigorate this region.
We believe this project is mutually beneficial.
Let’s think about that.
This village is mostly made up of residences and vacation homes.
OK.
Your glamping site is basically a camping-themed hotel, right?
Guests don’t eat out. They have barbecues.
Well, we can’t keep track of each guest’s actions.
I’m worried about the campfires.
Don’t worry, it’s forbidden. And we’ll have fixed BBQ spots.
You just said you can’t keep track of each guest.
There won’t be a caretaker on site from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., you said?
Correct.
So who will enforce campfire rules?
It’s a budget issue, no? You don’t want to pay for night shifts.
I don’t know about that…
I do.
I was a caretaker myself so I know how these things work.
But someone needs to be there around the clock.
People from the cities come here to decompress.
Some young people are bound to make a racket and light fires late at night.
This is a dry and windy region.
There have been big wildfires every few decades.
They could become more frequent once your glamping site arrives.
The site must have 24-hour supervision. If you can’t meet that demand, we’ll oppose the plans.
When does construction start?
It’s scheduled for May, but could be delayed a month.
That’s unfeasible.
I bet it’s the subsidies.
The subsidies have a cutoff date.
That’s why you’re rushing.
This briefing is just to make you look good on paper.
You’re throwing us under the bus just to make a quick buck.
You got a problem?
Let’s do this again.
Now you know the problems.
And we know that it’s no use talking to you.
Bring your boss and the consultant next time.
Not to shoot them down.
We haven’t taken a stance yet.
We’ll help if the plan is good.
My grandparents were settlers.
This region was opened up to people for farming after the war.
It doesn’t have a long history.
In a way, all of us here are outsiders.
Outsiders developed this region. They also damaged the environment.
Balance is key.
If you go overboard, you upset the balance.
Thank you.
We hope to arrange another briefing session.
We now realize how ignorant we were.
We would like to learn more, if you have time.
My name is Suruga. I’m the chief of this village.
It all boils down to what Takumi said earlier.
Water always flows downhill.
What you do upstream will end up affecting those living downstream.
Yes.
I’m not even talking about conservation.
But any activities upstream will add up, leaving a huge impact downstream.
The people upstream have to take the blame for that.
It leads to disputes.
To prevent this, upstream communities are expected to act responsibly.
That’s our duty.
We can’t let dirty water flow downstream just for the sake of some quick profits.
We need you to understand that.
In order to be part of this community, that’s the first thing you need to know.
Please make sure to convey that to your boss when you return to Tokyo.
Then we can talk again.
Hear, hear!
Go tell your boss!
Yes, you have a question?
I’m concerned about the number of staff. Do you think four is enough?
Well…
Thank you for your valuable input.
Tough crowd, eh?
Thank you for your time.
Let’s try again, alright?
Hana, it’s you!
Is this for me?
Yeah, you like it?
I do indeed.
Where’d you find it?
In the field.
I see.
Thanks for the gift. But don’t go there alone, OK?
You should get Takumi’s number.
He can help out if you ask him properly.
He knows everything about this area.
OK.
Do ask properly, though.
Got it.
Until next time.
Thank you for your feedback earlier.
Could you kindly give us a business card so we can contact you in the future?
Don’t have one.
I see.
Pass me that.
Pardon me for prying, but what do you do?
I’m a jack of all trades.
The local odd-job man.
Call me if you need anything.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time today.
Want some more?
It’s yummy.
Have a bite.
It’s in the way.
You stink.
Buttface.
This project is full of holes.
Of course it’s not perfect.
We’ll make changes as we proceed.
Then come to the next briefing and say that!
Why?
To convince the locals.
Well, I don’t think that will change their minds.
Here’s my takeaway. I think the briefing was a huge success.
How can you say that?
The briefing was held with two purposes in mind.
One is to show authorities that you are communicating with the locals.
The other is giving locals a chance to let out steam.
They were steamrolling us!
Hats off to you then.
You were able to find out what their gripes are.
Now you have to divide them into issues you can and can’t solve.
One demand you can meet is 24-hour supervision.
We can’t change the budget, so we have to cut down on staff.
That means lower quality of service, but it’s a compromise.
As for the septic tank issue, it’s possible to relocate it.
But it needs to be placed somewhere. One side has to take a hit.
I recommend keeping it as is, or you’ll end up incurring more costs.
A little pollution won’t affect the water.
Just show the locals you made an effort by accepting their caretaker demand.
I see.
The locals are not as stupid as you think, Mr. Horiguchi.
I never called them stupid.
I found their concerns to be quite reasonable after hearing them out.
If we can’t meet their requests, I think the plan itself is unfeasible.
Elaborate.
We need to rethink this plan from scratch.
What do you think, Mr. Hasegawa?
That’s impossible.
Why?
Why? Because of the subsidies!
It amounts to two months’ sales.
It goes into your paychecks too!
Yes, exactly.
Can you pull up page 13 from the slides I sent you?
As mentioned before, the demand for glamping has been on the rise.
To ensure your place in the market, you must enter it ahead of competitors.
OK, you can take it down now.
You can’t get a head start if you aim for perfection.
We just bought the land.
There’s no turning back.
But it’s not too late!
Mr. Horiguchi?
I have an idea.
Yeah?
Why not ask that odd job guy to be the caretaker?
Oh!
He’s influential, knows the area, and probably has time to spare.
We’re not sure if he does…
Nice idea!
Well, I have to get to another online meeting now.
Sorry for keeping you.
Let’s move forward with this idea.
Keep me updated.
OK, thank you.
Thanks. Talk to you soon.
Let’s call it quits.
No way.
Get to work.
What?
Go to the village right now.
Bring the guy booze.
Butter him up, Mayuzumi. Tell him how much we need him.
Takahashi, you’re driving.
You’ll get there by noon, right?
We can’t have any delays and can’t afford any more expenses.
No time like the present!
Good luck!
Where do we meet?
He shared a location. He’ll be there till 1 p.m.
Weird guy.
Yeah.
Hey, Mayuzumi.
Yeah?
Why don’t you quit?
What?
Quit this job.
Why?
I mean, why are you even doing this?
What’d you do before?
Care work.
Didn’t I say I was a certified care worker?
Then why do this?
Do what?
Why this industry?
Change of pace.
Big change.
I loved show business.
I bet it’s not what you expected.
No, it’s full of scumbags, just as I expected.
Ouch, that’s harsh.
Why’d you join?
Maybe a part of me was dysfunctional.
Like your brain?
My soul.
Then you shouldn’t be in this industry.
But I like how there’s no whitewashing in this job.
You make this old man worry.
You’re not much older than me.
I’ve been in show biz for 17 years.
Why’d you join this company?
Oh, I never told you?
You didn’t.
I started out as Mr. Tamura’s assistant.
Really? I had no idea.
Yep, I was even on some of his shows.
Wow, you used to act?
I enjoyed it, but then that incident happened with Mr. Tamura.
Yeah…
That’s when I realized that I’m better off being a talent agent.
I could relate to the actors. So I just went along with it.
You don’t have any regrets?
Wow, you sure dig deep.
Sorry.
I was already burned out by then, so it didn’t affect me.
What bothers me is aspiring actors who waste opportunities.
I wanna smack them.
But chances come to those who don’t chase them.
It’s so strange and unfair.
So you should just quit.
That was out of nowhere.
You didn’t join to set up a campsite.
It’s a glamping site.
Who cares?
How the heck did I end up in this mess?
Did I scare you?
A little.
More than a little. I don’t like it when people yell.
Would you hate it if I light a cig?
Can I open the windows?
Never mind then.
It’s fine.
Nah, I’ll smoke when we get there.
What’s so funny?
You’re lucky I’m not your girlfriend.
I don’t have one!
No wonder.
It’s a legit service!
Not a hookup app?
It’s not!
They do a background check. ID, salary and all.
You want a wife.
Yep.
Pretty ambitious, especially with our salary.
Don’t tease me.
I mean it.
Is your profile pic hot?
Zip it, kid.
It’s a big turn off for women if you talk like that.
Come on. I’m not gonna talk like that straight off the bat.
So you will once you’re married?
I’ll treat her nicely.
I bet you’ll be like, “Get me tea! Bring me food!”
Hey, I’m not that type of guy. I can be sweet!
You’re not on any apps?
I’ve tried it out.
How’d it go?
I went on a date, but stopped soon after.
Why?
I found it scary.
Something bad happen?
Not really. The date was quite nice.
What?
I was in a bad place mentally, so I didn’t want to lead him on.
I see.
Lots of trashy guys on the app too. I deleted my account.
There are better apps.
But do you really want to get married?
I do.
Why?
‘Cause I’m lonely.
What else would it be?
The pandemic took a toll on me too.
Just get a pet.
No way. I travel too much for work.
You don’t wanna get married?
Nope.
Really?
I’m sure about that.
Maybe I’ll get married and quit this job.
I should find a wife and move to the countryside.
Hope it works out.
Maybe the campsite caretaker should be me.
Why not.
I’ll get a dog too.
I’ll go visit you sometime.
Yeah, come visit!
What a great plan!
There he is.
Hey.
Thank you for meeting us on such short notice.
No big deal.
We have a small gift for you.
I don’t drink.
You could share it with the others.
Don’t want it.
Have you had lunch?
No, not yet.
Let’s eat after I’m done.
Alright.
I’ll be able to stop soon.
We can wait.
Let’s go.
OK.
Wait.
What is it?
Can I try that?
Put your strong foot forward.
OK.
Keep your eyes on the log.
OK.
Let the axe slide down as you swing.
That felt great!
Let’s go.
Hop in my car. Not much parking there.
OK.
For table three.
OK.
What do you think about the caretaker idea?
I’m not a loafer.
Of course not.
And I don’t need the money.
We also thought it was a bit much to ask you to be the caretaker.
At the briefing, we realized how ignorant we were about this region.
We would like to learn from you.
Would it be possible for you to take on the role of our advisor?
Yes, you’d make the perfect advisor.
Let me share something personal with you.
See, I’m a talent agent. That’s my main role.
But I want to do something different.
I was thinking of changing my career.
I’m hoping to become the caretaker.
That’s why I want to learn more about this area.
I want to connect with locals to deliver this project.
Maybe you could start off by becoming my advisor.
Teach me everything from scratch.
Please.
It felt great chopping wood earlier. I haven’t felt like that in years.
I felt like this was the place for me.
It’s on a deer trail.
Huh?
Your glamping site.
So we have to put up deer fences?
They can jump over two meters.
You need a three-meter fence.
Wouldn’t that deter visitors?
It’s a genuine question.
Thank you for the delicious meal.
Thanks.
It really warmed me up!
That’s got nothing to do with taste.
Don’t pay for us!
Thanks for coming!
Got enough water?
We’ve been using a lot. It’s running out.
I’ll go get some now.
I can’t go today.
I have helpers.
You’re 180 yen short.
Mayuzumi.
We’ll take you to the station.
Huh?
You can take the train back to Tokyo.
What about you?
I’ll stay here a bit.
Thanks.
I’ll do it.
I’ll stay too. It’ll be my last task.
You smoke?
Yeah, I do.
Thanks.
Gunshots.
They’re hunting deer.
It’s my first time hearing gunshots.
Same.
How’d you know then?
Just a guess. What else could it be?
She left by herself again.
Got it.
Can I…
Can I ask you something?
Yeah?
Do deer attack people?
No.
But I’ve heard of them attacking people in tourist spots.
They see people a lot.
The deer here don’t attack.
You’re sure?
I’m sure.
Unless…
it’s a gut-shot deer, or its parent.
Gut-shot?
Hit by a bullet.
It might fight back if it can’t run.
Very unlikely though.
Wild deer are timid. They avoid people.
In that case, the deer trail might not be a bad thing.
It’ll be a chance for city people to interact with wild animals.
Good point.
Touching them is risky.
They carry diseases.
But they avoid people, right?
So they won’t get touched.
Maybe the deer won’t even come near the glamping site.
Where would they go?
Somewhere else, I guess.
Hana!
Hana, are you here?
Call out if you’re here, Hana!
She didn’t come here.
Where could she be?
Too many places.
Maybe she went home.
What happened to you?
Got cut.
Show me.
Come on!
Whoa!
That’s deep.
Clutch your wrist.
Alright.
Lift it high.
You’ll stop bleeding.
Sorry to trouble you.
No, it’s my fault.
Can you wait here a bit?
Of course.
I’ll call if she comes back.
Make yourself at home. There’s food.
Takumi!
I’ll come with you!
This is a public announcement.
A child has been reported missing.
Hana Yasumura, eight years old, has not been seen since 4 p.m.
She is about 120 cm tall and has long, black hair.
She was last seen wearing a blue jacket, jeans, and a gray wool hat.
If you have any information, please contact local law enforcement.
I repeat.
This is a public announcement.

Come here!
We checked the south. Can you try this area?
Hana!

What?
What are you doing?!

FRANK: Hey! Come on. Let’s move!
MARY: No!
FRANK: Let me see.
MARY: No!
Come on. I made you a special breakfast.
MARY: You can’t cook.
Hey, Mary, open up!
You look beautiful.
I look like a Disney character.
(SIGHS)
Where’s the “special”?
The what?
You said you made me a special breakfast.
Please don’t make me go.
You can keep homeschooling me.
I’ve taught you everything I know.
But I don’t wanna go.
Well, I don’t wanna go to work, but I do.
You don’t go to work. You fix the boats on a dock.
Okay. It’s a poor example, but you’re still going.
But what about Fred?
FRANK: What about him?




MARY: You won’t take care of him.
You don’t like cats.
I don’t like two-eyed cats.
Fred, as you know, is monocular.
Who’s gonna throw him his ping pong ball?
Fred’s gonna be fine. No more argument, okay?
We’ve discussed this ad nauseam.
What’s ad nauseam?
Oh, you don’t know?
Well, looks like someone needs school.
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
This is gonna be fun.
You’re gonna meet kids today
you can borrow money from the rest of your life.
Come on.
You’re gonna be great.
You know, just…
I don’t know. Try bein’ a kid.
(KNOCKING)
ROBERTA: Mmm-mmm.
Frank!
Frank, I know you hear me.
Frank!
(LOCKS DOOR)
(DOORKNOB RATTLING)




There’s still time for you to undo this nonsense.
Go get in your car and go get that child.
Are you technically allowed to
use those keys whenever you want?
How can you stand there…
acting all calm and everything, Frank,
and make light of this?
Now go get her back before it’s too late.
She gotta get out in the world.
She has no friends her age.
No social skills.
She doesn’t know how to be a kid.
Two nights ago, she told me
that even if Germany bails out the euro…
there could still be a worldwide depression.
I was staring at the ceiling for three hours.
(CRYING) I’m so worried.
(SIGHS) Come on, Roberta.
If you start crying,
I’m gonna have to pretend to start crying.
Hey.
You know, there’s something you could be overlookin’.
This could work out.
Maybe.
But if anybody takes that baby away…




I’ll smother you in your sleep.
Morning, Fred.

(SIGHS)
BONNIE: One plus one is two.
That is fact number one of today.
Who can tell me what two plus two is?
Who’s got it?
Mmm-hmm?
Four.
Excellent, Donna.
It is. Two plus two is, indeed, four.
Okay, who wants to try three plus three?
Three plus three? Really?
I beg your pardon?
What kinda school is this anyway?
It’s the kind of school
where students don’t speak without permission.
All right. But everyone knows it’s six.
Nobody in this classroom speaks…
unless they are called upon.
Okay? Is everybody clear on that?
STUDENTS: Yes, ma’am.
Good. Mary, can you stand up please?




Stand on up. Stand up, babe.
These questions are for you because you’re so advanced.
What is nine plus eight?
17.
Yeah. Yes, it is. That’s good.
What is…
15 plus 17?
32.
(STAMMERS) Yeah. That is right.
All right, then.
Well, what is 57 plus 135?
192.
Yeah.
Can you tell me…
what 57 multiplied by 135 is?
(EXHALES)
Okay.
Who can tell me what four…
7,695.
GIRL: I don’t think anyone can do that.
MARY: The square root is 87.7.
And change.
Now what does ad nauseam mean?
I have a very strange kid.
I have 27 strange kids.
Good morning.
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
BONNIE: That’s great, guys, but take your seats, okay?
Oh, God. See ya.
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.
Good morning.
Mind if I sit in?
Not at all!
Okay, class.
I have a treat for you.
I would like to introduce you to our principal, Mrs. Davis.
Good morning, first graders.
STUDENTS: Good morning, Mrs. Davis.
Are you ready for a great year?
STUDENTS: Yes!
Uh… Yes, Mary?
She’s the boss?
Mrs. Davis is our principal. Mm-kay…
Okay. Now I want you
to get on your phone and call Frank…
and tell him to get me out of here!
AMANDA: Wait a minute. That’s the dad? I know him.
I see him at Ferg’s almost every Friday night.
He’s the quiet, damaged hot guy.
What are you doing at Ferg’s every Friday night?




Trying to get picked up by him.
Excuse me? Hi.
Oh. Look, it’s my teacher.
Probably wants to remind me what one plus one is.
Go to the car, okay?
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry to yell at you and then chase you down.
It’s okay. Mary’s teacher?
Yes. I’m Bonnie Stevenson.
Frank. How are you? Sorry about today.
I know she got a little overexcited.
I think it’s just first day jitters.
Sure. Yeah.
We’re running a little late actually. We gotta get going.
Okay. I don’t even wanna talk about that.
I’ll keep you just a minute.
Okay.
I think your daughter…
I think Mary might be gifted.
What?
Yeah. Today in Math, she answered some really…
Oh, no, no, no. That’s…
No, please.
It’s not gifted.
Really difficult questions.
All right.
Just that a seven-year-old would…
It’s Trachtenberg.
Jakow Trachtenberg.
I’m sorry?
Spent seven years in a Nazi concentration camp.
Developed a system to rapidly solve problems.
It’s the Trachtenberg method.
But she’s…
I mean, she’s seven though.
I learned it when I was eight.
Do I look gifted to you?
It’s kind of gone out of vogue
since the invention of the calculator…
but, uh, I can still win a drink at a bar using it.
Sorry for today.
Won’t happen again.
Okay.
Nice to meet you. Bonnie.
Frank.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
(ENGINE STARTS)
Hmm.
For the record, I didn’t wanna go




to the stupid school in the first place.
And the boy in the next row
acts inappropriately for someone who’s a child.
I’m sorry. I’m still passive aggressively ignoring you.
Other kids answer questions. They don’t get into trouble.
You didn’t get in trouble for answering questions.
You yelled at the principal.
You know what? You’re gonna find this interesting.
So, I googled “first graders who yell at the principal…”
and statistically, you’re never gonna
believe how many kids do it.
How many?
None.
(STARTS MOTOR)
Frank, I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.
Yeah, right.
You can’t show off like that at school.
I know.
You promised you wouldn’t, then the first day…
I know, I know. I screwed up.
Do you think maybe this boat needs a test ride?
Go get Fred.
Don’t run.
(music playing)
I listen to the wind To the wind of my soul
Where I’ll end up Well, I think
Only God really knows
I’ve sat upon the setting sun
But never, never, never, never
I never wanted water once
No, never, never, never
Fred loves to watch the sandpipers.
He thinks he’d like to catch one…
but he’d regret it.
Fred’s not a killer.
He’s a lover.
(MARY SIGHS)
Would my mom have wanted me to go to this school?
I can only guess.
But I’ll tell you what,
she would have wanted you to have friends.
Idiot friends?
And she’d want you to have compassion for others.
Like a cat can have for a sandpiper.
But what if they don’t like me?
Then they’re idiots.
Good morning, class.
STUDENTS: Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.
Good morning, Mary.
(SING-SONG) Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.
Okay, good morning.
Get a hold of yourself.
For my Show and Tell, I have…
the most awesome cat in the history of time.
Not only is his name Fred, but…
(FRED MEOWS)
He has just one eye.
Uno. Go ahead and count…
but I promise you, it’s always one.
How did he lose his eye?
I don’t know. I wasn’t there.
Just found him inside of a trash can
next to a bottle of alcohol or something.
He is a smart, smart cat, but no one realizes that.
No one understands him. No one.
BONNIE: Put your name on the top of the paper…
so that I know who did such good work.
BOY: I left my pen with you.
BONNIE: Pass those around, guys.
Okay? I wanna see your work.
Turn around, face the desk.
Think about how you get to the answer.
It’s not just about, you know, guessing.
Don’t be messy.
Done.
(TAPPING PEN ON DESK)
Let’s see.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay. I thought you might finish quickly,
so a little something extra.
Done.
(TYPING)
(GASPS)
Oh…
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Do you know who I am?
Hey! Mary’s teacher…
BOTH: Bonnie.
You lied to me.
Okay.
Can you narrow it down?
Mmm-hmm.
I’d like to know the truth about Mary, my student…
your niece.
FRANK: I was running
ridiculously late for a date…
and my sister showed up with Mary.
And she never just showed up unannounced.
She never showed up with the baby.
She said she wanted to talk.
She said she needed to talk.
I told her I would talk to her when I got back.
I think I figured showing up that late to my date…
would hurt my chances of gettin’ laid.
Came home that night and Mary was on the couch…
and found Diane on the bathroom floor.
I mean, there’s no way I coulda known…
but I shoulda known.
Six and a half years later,
me and Mary are still hangin’ out.
And what about the father?
(SCOFFS)
Diane was so socially awkward…
she didn’t date enough to know a good guy from a bad guy.
This particular guy didn’t last a month.
And no grandparents?
Dad died when I was eight. My mom… (SCOFFS)
Short version is she turned her back on Diane
when she got pregnant.
Why?
Didn’t fit into her plan.
She’s an exacting woman, my mother.
Uncompromising.
Very British.
Do you mean, British in demeanor or…
No. Like she’s…
She’s from England.
From England. Yeah.
(SIGHS)
So, Mary is a genius?
(SIGHS)
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
ALL: Oh!
(BOY LAUGHING)
Look out. Look out.
Your little animals are escaping, dumbass.
Hey! You should not be laughing!
You did a mean thing to a little kid!
What are you gonna do about it?
(SMACKS)
(CRYING)
Hey. Hey, you okay?
You good? All right.
How do we resolve this?
You know, she could be expelled.
God. I hope not.
But if every other first-time offender was expelled,
I guess fair is fair.
Are you gonna take this seriously?
Sure. You don’t bluff me, I don’t bluff you.
Ms. Stevenson believes
that your child is exceptional…
and has talents that our curriculum
can’t begin to challenge.
It just so happens
that I am good friends with the headmaster
of the Oaks Academy for Gifted Education.
He has always said
that if I find that one in a million…
And the one in a million has a $30,000 tuition.
Mr. Adler, I can get your daughter a scholarship.
Full ride.
I wouldn’t say it if I couldn’t do it.
(EXHALES)
I realize, putting that girl in that setting,
you know, 99 times out of a 100, that’s what you do.
It’s the Oaks. It’s a great school.
I looked into it.
But this family has a history with those schools.
And I think the last thing that little girl needs
is reinforcement that she’s different.
Trust me, she knows. So…
I think Mary, I think she’s gotta be here.
Today’s a bad ending. You can’t hit people.
But a 12-year-old bullies a seven-year-old
and she stands up?
Do you know how important it is to me that she did that?
You know how proud I am of her? Aren’t you?
Mr. Adler, your daughter shattered a young boy’s…
I know. You can’t hit people.
That will be made very clear. I get that.
But Mrs. Davis, if we separate our leaders,
if we segregate them from people like you and me,
you get congressmen.
So, I’m sorry.
I wish I could take your offer, but Mary stays.
Unless you kick her out.
This is a mistake. We’ll never be able to raise this child
to the level of scholarship she deserves.
Well, just dumb her down into a decent human being.
Everybody wins.
(DOOR OPENS)
You know what? Can you excuse me one minute?
Bring me every piece of paperwork
we have on this girl.
Hey.
Are you sure you know what you’re doing?
No.
Okay. Mary, I think
you have something you’d like to say to the class.
You wanna hop up and say it?
Okay. I’m supposed to say something.
Hitting people is wrong even if they’re bad.
I won’t do it again, so don’t be afraid of me.
Okay. Thank you.
Now can I say something I wanna say?
Sure.
Before they ruined it,
Justin’s zoo was the best art project.
By far. It was awesome.
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)
Come on. A little harder.
(ALL APPLAUDING)
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
There’s a lady standing in front of our door.
Who is it?
How should I know? I’m seven.
(STOPS ENGINE)
That would be your grandmother.
Holy shit!
An Apple? Whoa.
It’s a MacBook, darling.
Top of the line with the Retina Display.
Hey, you know who else has a Retina Display?
Fred!
Mary, I understand you like mathematics.
So, on there,
you’ll find a great
out-of-print book by Charles Zimmer
called Transitions in Advanced Algebra.
Yeah. Love that book.
You’re saying you’ve read it?
Yeah. I’ve kind of moved on to differential equations now.
Don’t forget your manners. Thank your grandma.
Thank you, Grandma.
Grandmother or Evelyn will do just fine.
There’s so much more on there.
Things I know you’ll find really challenging.
Yes. But sadly, it’s a school night
and there’s homework to do.
What a surprise though, right?
Say good night to Grandmother or Evelyn.
Good night.
I’d kill a priest for a Benadryl.
Still with the allergies?
Why in God’s name have you got a cat?
You don’t even like cats.
It’s not my cat. It’s Mary’s cat.
I’m just along for the ride.
So let me guess.
Our lovely principal, Ms. Davis.
Never get on the bad side of small-minded people
who have a little authority.
I thought I taught you that.
What are you doin’ here?
You don’t think I have the right
to see my granddaughter?
I do. I’m thrilled your seven-year exhaustive search
has finally come to a fruitful conclusion.
I don’t think this is an appropriate time to talk.
Certainly not the setting.
While I was waiting, a cockroach this big
tried to steal my shoe.
Yeah. They’ll take a shoe.
Honestly, this?
This godforsaken mosquito ranch was a conscious choice?
I could drop you back off at the airport.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
(ENGINE STARTS)
This thing is loaded with cool problems.
EVELYN: So, are you teaching?
FRANK: I repair boats.
Please.
I’m not bad at it either.
Well, then, that explains this.
They don’t sell sunscreen here?
I wear sunscreen.
Not enough. And you need a hat.
A big hat that shades your face and neck.
You’re playing Russian roulette with your skin.
You look like a porn producer.
Okay. I appreciate the advice. I do.
But we’re not here to talk about sunscreen, are we?
Oh, so no more small talk? That’s a shame.
Okay. The environment you have created for that child
where she lives, the school she attends,
it’s substandard, every bit of it.
I disagree.
We’re getting nowhere
if we’re not gonna be honest with each other.
I am being honest.
I see. Fine. Well, I’m not leaving without her.
Well, welcome to Florida.
Frank, please listen to reason.
At some point, either you’re gonna come to the conclusion,
or someone in authority
is going to spell it out for you
that the child’s best interest is all that matters.
You’re gonna make me pull rank, I will.
Diane didn’t want you to have her.
Diane…
Diane didn’t always think things through.
Arguably one of the brightest minds on the planet.
Good luck going down that road.
And what do you think she’d say
if she saw how her child is living now?
Do you honestly think she’d be pleased?
That she’s living a somewhat normal life? Yes. I do.
She’s not normal. And treating her as such…
is negligence on a grand scale.
I know your heart’s in the right place on this.
But you are denying the girl her potential. You are.
I can provide for her, I can enrich her life.
Oh, come on, Evelyn. You’re gonna take that girl,
you’re gonna bury her in tutors…
then you’re gonna loan her out to some think tank…
where she can talk non-trivial zeros…
with a bunch of old Russian guys for the rest of her life.
And you’d bury her under a rock.
Look, I don’t expect you to understand
the price you have to pay for greatness.
Oh, I do. That’s why I have Mary in the first place.
That’s uncalled for.
Your sister had a laundry list of problems.
She could have solved Navier-Stokes
and gone down in history…
as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.
But she didn’t because she couldn’t finish.
She was weak.
Weak like her father and weak like…
Well…
Now, if it’s who I think it is…
Kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon.
You’re still stubborn and vindictive.
Careful, Mother.
There’s an apple and tree analogy lurking.
You guys ready to order?
Here’s an idea.
Stop thinking about me and you…
and start thinking about what’s best for the child.
For any reasonable person, a clear picture will emerge.
If it doesn’t, I suggest you call your attorney.
He’ll have the bucket of beer.
Hey, let’s go outside.
No.
Come on. It’s nice out.
I don’t care.
Hey, no more math today.
(GROANS)
MARY: Is there a God?
FRANK: I don’t know.
MARY: Just tell me.
FRANK: I would if I could.
But I don’t know. And neither does anybody else.
MARY: Roberta knows.
FRANK: No. Roberta has faith
and that’s a great thing to have.
But faith’s about what you think, feel.
Not what you know.
MARY: What about Jesus?
FRANK: Love that guy. Do what he says.
MARY: But is he God?
FRANK: I don’t know.
I have an opinion.
But that’s my opinion. I could be wrong.
So why would I screw up yours?
Use your head.
But don’t be afraid to believe in things either.
MARY: Huh. There was a guy on TV
who said there was no God.
FRANK: The only difference
between the atheists on TV and Roberta…
is that Roberta loves you. She’s trying to help.
Tell you what though.
One way or another,
we all end up back together in the end.
That’s what you’re asking, right?
MARY: Yep.
FRANK: Okay.
Find something else to worry about, will you?
MARY: All right.
Okay. Adler, grandmother and uncle.
Really?
You sure you folks don’t wanna go out
in the hallway and settle this?
No? Well, that’s a shame.
Mr. Cullen, you are here for the uncle.
Yes, sir, Your Honor.
Start charging you room and board.
Mr. Highsmith,
you’re on the wrong side of the bay, aren’t you?
(CHUCKLES) I’m very happy to be here, Your Honor.
For the record, Mrs. Dibbons
is representing the State of Florida
Child Welfare Department.
Proceed.
Your Honor, my client, Mrs. Adler
is the maternal grandmother of the child.
Her daughter, the girl’s mother,
was a troubled woman…
who seven years ago, sadly, took her own life.
It was at this time that Mr. Adler
preemptively and illegally…
took custody of the girl
and spirited her across state lines…
for the purpose of denying my client custody.
Now, there is evidence that the child currently lives…
in unclean and unwholesome conditions.
We petition the court to grant my client
full custody of the child…
so that she may be returned
to the state of Massachusetts…
and given the care to which she is entitled.
My client took an infant under his wing for one reason only.
It was his sister’s desire that he do so.
My client has been her constant caregiver.
And, Your Honor, as far as the living conditions…
I’ve been in this home. It’s fine.
I mean, if we adopt standards based on…
our northern friend’s aversion to palmetto bugs…
we won’t have a child left south of Tallahassee.
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)
(CHUCKLES)
All right. Last chance before this starts
costing a lot more money.
Your Honor, my client would need
reasonable access to the child.
So ordered.
Ms. Dibbons, you’ll go over there
and check out the living conditions?
On the books, Your Honor.
All right, folks. Drive carefully.
(GALLERY MURMURING)
Her lawyer has a nice suit.
Relax, Frank. More weight’s put on the talent competition.
Go have a cocktail, hmm?
Roberta, would you like to have Mary tonight?
Why wouldn’t I like to have Mary tonight?
(SCOFFS)
I told you something like this would happen.
Now look where we are.
And I’m supposed to believe you know what you’re doing.
You couldn’t even find a white lawyer.
Wow. Look, just…
Don’t worry, okay?
Don’t tell me that.
There’s nothing you can say
that’s gonna make me feel good…
because I have no say in any of this, Frank.
I’m not a blood relative,
I’m not a legal guardian. I’m nothing!
Just the lady who lives next door,
whose opinion means nothing…
whose feelings mean nothing.
Would I like to have Mary tonight? (SCOFFS)
I’d like to have Mary every night.
(SINGING) Can’t stop me now Hear what I say
My feets gotta move, so…
Get out of my way
I’m gonna have my say
I’m going to every discotheque
I’m gonna dance, dance, dance Whoo!
Till the break of day
Oh, shame, shame, shame, shame
Oh!
Shame on you
If you can’t dance too
And I said shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame Shame on you
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Hi.
Hi.
Um, I heard Davis bragging about a custody case
and then I found out whose…
I feel terrible.
But I also wanted you to know that after we talked…
I didn’t say anything to anyone.
I swear.
And it’s, um, important to me that you know that.
I know.
Okay.
My lawyer told me to get drunk.
And you’re trying to do it with that?
Okay. My turn.
Who was your first celebrity crush?
Um, I’ll go with…
Mona from Who’s the Boss?
Oh, wow!
You know who I’m talking about?
The sexy grandmother.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah!
I always felt like she had a secret.
Yeah, which is that she loved sexual intercourse.
That was it.
And she wasn’t secret about it.
That’s why I liked her.
(LAUGHS)
You know what? I liked her, too.
See?
All right. Um…
Least favorite student. And why.
Oh, no! I love all my students.
I don’t believe you. At all! Not for a second.
No, they’re all great.
They’re all so great.
I’m gonna go ahead and drink.
Let’s keep this honest.
He? She?
Uh, he is Ronnie Middleton.
Sounds like a dick.
(LAUGHS)
He’s a little child, okay?
I’m sorry.
The point is that he’s evil in his core.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
And there’s nothing I can do.
Wow.
(CLEARS THROAT)
What’s your greatest fear?
Wow!
That’s a change of tone.
Yup, I’m a really serious person.
Okay.
Look, if it’s too much, you can just drink your drink…
and live with the fact that you’re afraid.
No, I can handle this. Um…
That I’ll ruin Mary’s life.
You’re very, um…
surprising, Mary’s teacher.
Very much so.
Okay. Hold on. I’m sorry.
(LAUGHS) What?
Just so that…
I feel like I need to say this…
just so that there’s no misconception.
Oh, God. No, I didn’t…
No, hold on!
That this can’t, isn’t happening.
I get it. I know. I’m with you.
Yeah? Okay.
100%. We’re on the same page.
Good!
No, that’s great. I’m sorry. That’s embarrassing.
It’s okay. I get it.
BOTH: Oh!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I’m good.
Okay. Good.
Can you promise that there’s no way?
Yes. Roberta has Mary
every Saturday till noon, I promise.
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Sorry.
(SIGHS)
I can’t do this.
(EXHALES) Okay.
Okay.
I understand.
I’ll take you home.
Yeah.
Sorry, just… One more time.
(LAUGHS)
(BLIND CLACKING)
MARY: I can’t find my DVD.
ROBERTA: It’s right there, baby.
No, it isn’t. You come and find it.
ROBERTA: I’m doing lady business.
Now, you were the last person to watch it.
What did you do with it?
Oh…
(GROANING)
(SIGHS)
(GASPS) Oh! Oh, my God!
(EXHALES HEAVILY)
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.
Hi.
Look, I am…
Oh, you know what? I’m actually incapable…
of having this conversation right now.
Good. ‘Cause I have no idea what I was gonna say.
(CHUCKLES)
Great! Perfect!
Sir, if you please. Take me to jail.
(SING-SONG) Awkward.
Mary…
Stop! Stop!
Stop with the Legos! Listen.
Do we have a rule about Saturday morning?
What?
Are you allowed in this apartment this early
on Saturday morning? Yes or no?
No.
No!
(LEGOS RATTLING)
Are you allowed to… Hey!
Stop! Enough with the Legos.
Are you allowed to use Roberta’s keys?
No.
No!
Hey! Look at me.
Then why are you here, huh?
Can you answer me that?
You broke every rule!
You just embarrassed me.
We have these rules.
We’ve gone over them a hundred times! Ahh!
God!
Damn it!
Can I just get five minutes of my own life?
(SLAMS DOOR)
(FRANK SIGHS)
Nothing that happened today was your fault.
I got mad at you…
I was really mad at me.
And the manufacturers of Legos,
they should all be in prison.
I’m sorry.
Do you forgive me?
Sure. Whatever.
Hey, close the laptop. Come on.
Please. Doesn’t count if it’s not eye to eye.
Come on, please.
(SIGHS)
Do you really have no life because of me?
That’s not what I said.
Hmm.
Did you mean it?
Last month you said I was
the worst uncle in the world…
and you wished death upon me
’cause I didn’t buy you a piano.
Did you mean that?
No.
Not entirely.
There you go.
We say things all the time we don’t mean. So…
Let’s forget it, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
(FRANK SIGHS)
Frank?
Yeah?
Can I have a piano?
No.
Was that really Mary’s teacher this morning?
You know, I got a book called
Fundamentals of Decision Making.
You can borrow it.
What is it?
It’s nothing.
Looks like Mary gets to go to Boston for a couple days.
It’s just two days.
Relax.
EVELYN: So, what do you think?
MARY: Cool.
Wow! You and my mom…
were always together.
Always.
Oh, no, you don’t want to look at that one.
Is that you?
Yes.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
How old were you?
EVELYN: 29.
MARY: Where is this?
That’s Cambridge University.
In England.
MARY: Who are those people?
My research colleagues.
For what?
Mathematics, of course.
Really?
Cool!
So, then you came to work…
at a college in America?
EVELYN: No.
I married your grandfather…
and I came back to America with him.
And I had children.
Oh.
So, no more math?
It’s late.
You’ve got a big day tomorrow.
Come on. Up, up, up.
MARY: Can I play the piano?
EVELYN: No, you can’t.
Now stop dragging those feet.
But, it’s fun!
EVELYN: Come on!
BONNIE: I have had a series of nightmares…
where I’m fired…
because of what happened.
(CHUCKLES) You get it?
And then I try to rationalize…
that everything that happened was just all alcohol.
(CHUCKLES)
I have an addiction to fixer guys.
(FRANK LAUGHS)
Dr. Shankland, this problem is…
I know. Just copy it exactly as you see it written.
But it’s…
Exactly as written. Thank you.
MARY: So, what’s this problem I’m supposed to look at?
I don’t know.
Is it like the problems Mom worked on?
Your mother didn’t work on problems.
She worked on just one problem.
Just one?
Her entire life?
Most of it.
Look.
These are the Millennium Problems.
Seven great and meaningful problems.
Some mathematicians have worked
their entire lives to prove them.
Who’s the dude with the beard?
(CHUCKLES) That’s not a dude.
That’s Grigori Perelman.
He proved the Poincaré conjecture.
The only one of the seven proved.
This…
This is your mother’s problem.
Na… vi…
Navier-Stokes.
No picture.
She didn’t solve it?
No.
She was close.
She would have won the Fields Medal…
and probably shared a Nobel…
considering what it would have meant for physics.
Maybe I’ll have my picture up here someday.
If you really desire it…
you can have your picture there, darling.
I can help you.
It takes focus and hard work, but if you succeed…
your name will live forever.
Don’t be smug, Seymore.
Well, she’s had plenty of time.
She traveled yesterday. She slept in a strange bed.
Give her a chance.
At six years old, she read Zimmer.
Outstanding.
How much did she comprehend?
So, Mary…
I see you’re looking at our little problem.
MARY: Little? It’s big.
Yeah.
MARY: Why are you so mad all of a sudden?
I’m not mad. I’m annoyed.
Not with you, dear.
With that pompous ass, Shankland.
I knew that guy was gonna have a beard
before we even went in there.
Math teachers like to grow beards.
I should never have agreed to this in the first place.
Did he really expect you
to just walk in and be able to dissect…
some random, massive problem?
Not much to dissect, if you ask me.
Why do you say that?
It was wrong.
What?
Well, for starters,
he forgot the negative sign on the exponent.
It went downhill from there.
The problem was unsolvable.
Maybe this school isn’t as great as you think it is.
Mary, you knew the problem was incorrect.
Why didn’t you say anything?
Frank says I’m not supposed to correct older people.
(CHUCKLES)
Nobody likes a smart-ass.
I’m loaded with swag!
Wanna come inside?
Cat.
MARY: Frank, I think this is stupid.
Why don’t we just call Evelyn
and tell her I don’t wanna do this?
Because like I told you,
Evelyn didn’t order this. The court did.
So again, what are we gonna do?
Tell the truth.
Exactly.
Sooner we answer these questions,
sooner we get to go home.
So, no attitude, okay?
Okay.
(SIGHS) Frank?
Mary.
I like Evelyn.
She looks like my mom.
And she has a piano.
But I don’t wanna live with her.
She’s bossy.
I’ve heard that.
Hey.
Don’t worry. You’re not going anywhere.
Promise?
I promise.
Hi, Mary. I’m Pat Golding,
but you can call me Pat if you like.
Got it.
Do you know why you’re here?
I mean has anyone told you what this is about?
My grandmother wants me to live with her
and I wanna stay with Frank.
That’s correct.
I’m sure this can all be very scary stuff.
Does any of it worry you?
Nope. Frank says I’m not goin’ anywhere.
Your uncle told you you’re not going anywhere?
Just 15 minutes ago.
So, we done here?
Not quite yet.
My best friend other than Frank and Fred is Roberta…
who lives a couple houses away.
Really? What’s she like?
She’s nice and funny. And I love her.
(CHUCKLES) That’s nice.
Is Roberta your only friend your age?
Roberta’s not my age. She’s like 40, 50…
30-something.
Roberta’s a grown woman?
People my age are boring.
Roberta’s cool.
Okay.
I don’t watch TV.
But I got hooked on SpongeBob.
Mostly because Roberta loves it.
Oh. And on Saturday nights, we watch the UFC.
The UFC? Is that…
Is that Ultimate Fighting?
Every Saturday.
You and your uncle watch Ultimate Fighting?
Well, you don’t just watch it.
Frank turns the sound down
and we do the grunting and voices.
Hmm.
Sometimes I attack Frank for real.
Which is really fun for me.
I think if you guys knew Frank,
you’d leave us alone.
He can be pretty annoying…
but he’s a good person.
I think.
Why do you say that?
He wanted me before I was smart.
HIGHSMITH: Mr. Pollard, are you…
the natural father of Mary Adler?
Yes, I am.
And how can you be certain of this?
POLLARD: Well, I always knew, but then you had me…
take a DNA test.
I would offer the test results
as presumptive evidence that Mr. Pollard…
is the father and natural guardian of the minor.
As well as an affidavit…
from Mr. Pollard nominating…
Mrs. Adler, the maternal grandmother,
as the legal guardian of the minor.
No objections.
Mr. Pollard…
has Mrs. Adler offered you any monetary reward…
or employment for coming forward today?
No, sir. I have a job of my own.
HIGHSMITH: Thank you.
No further questions, Your Honor.
CULLEN: Mr. Pollard…
when was the last time you saw Mary?
Uh… I’ve never seen her.
CULLEN: Oh, why not?
POLLARD: By the time I heard about Diane…
passing…
the baby was gone already.
CULLEN: Well, did you try and find her?
Best I could.
I couldn’t just go and search the entire country.
CULLEN: Do you use a computer at work?
POLLARD: Sure.
You know what? Help me out.
Here, let’s google “Mary Adler”
and, uh, see what we find.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
You know what?
Uh, you better add her middle name.
It’ll narrow it down.
Eileen.
Yeah. Hit Enter.
(KEYBOARD CLACKS)
Page 2.
Second hit.
Would you please tell the court what you see there?
It’s a newspaper article called
“Not So Terrible Twos.”
And one of them is Mary Eileen Adler.
Same name as your daughter.
Born on the same day as your daughter.
With a photograph.
Um, in your defense, you’d never recognize it…
Your Honor, this is…
CULLEN: Your Honor…
if there’s one thing here that’s sadly obvious…
it’s that Mr. Pollard has never been
a genuine guardian of the minor…
and his nomination of Mrs. Adler
is no less disingenuous.
While the State of Florida gives deference
to nomination by a natural parent…
I’m inclined to side with Mr. Cullen’s laptop…
at this time.
Thank you, Your Honor.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
Don’t gloat.
Wouldn’t dream of it.
Walk you to your car?
We’ve been so preoccupied, I’m almost ashamed to ask.
How’s Walter?
(SCOFFS)
You wouldn’t believe it if I told you.
Why?
Well, your stepfather is in Montana.
He bought a ranch.
Bullshit.
Exactly. A man whose idea of roughing it…
is being too far from the ice machine at the Ritz-Carlton…
now owns a 1,000 acres of grass and dung.
Walter Price is a cowboy.
Walter Price puts on a Brooks Brothers suit
to take out the garbage.
He has a cowboy hat and cowboy boots…
and a horse that doesn’t know dressage.
Is there some logical reason for this?
Midlife crisis, apparently.
He’s 70.
I know.
Must have been on time delay or something.
I guess I should be happy
it wasn’t a 25-year-old cocktail waitress.
But then again,
an affair you can explain to friends in a minute.
For this, you put on a pot of coffee.
And he’s out there right now?
Yessiree!
Ridin’ the range. Punchin’ doggies.
(IMITATES JOHN WAYNE) He had a six gun on his hip…
and a saddlebag full of Lipitor.
The fastest asset management in the West.
The man who shot Liberty Mutual.
That’s what I’ve been calling him.
(CHUCKLES)
That’s really, really funny.
Take her to the airport.
Go home, Evelyn.
Or Montana. Rustle some cattle.
You know…
I have no desire to hurt you.
I hate it that we’re at odds.
We’re always at odds.
Yes.
Hotel.
ROBERTA: Mary, baby, come on now.
Stop this now.
(CRYING) No.
Come on out, honey.
No.
Why did you have to tell her that deadbeat was testifying?
Because it’s the truth.
And if I didn’t, Evelyn would’ve.
If I was the dad of a little girl
and I never saw her…
and I was in the same town…
I would visit her.
Well, I hope you’re happy.
He didn’t even need directions.
He could’ve followed you here.
Speaking of men who aren’t worth a damn.
(CRYING)
Doesn’t even wanna see what I look like.
All right.
Hey, put your shoes on. We’re going for a ride.
You too.
A ride?
MARY: What are we doing here?
FRANK: Waiting.
(ANNOUNCEMENT ON PA)
We can see that.
Why?
Because I said so.
How long do we have to stay here?
As long as it takes.
And keep your voice down. It’s a hospital.
Food’s here.
Yeah, food’s here.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
(EXHALES) It’s a boy.
(ALL CHEERING EXCITEDLY)
Way to go!
(LAUGHING)
That’s exactly how it was when you were born.
This happy?
This happy.
Who came out and told everybody?
I did.
Can we stay for another?
(INAUDIBLE)
Mrs. Adler, in your earlier testimony, here today…
you’ve painted a pretty dim picture of your own son.
Don’t you think?
I’m under oath.
I take no pleasure in it.
So, your son’s a failure in life,
your daughter took her life.
You know, you’re oh for two.
HIGHSMITH: Objection!
Withdrawn.
If I go one for three, I’m in the Hall of Fame.
You know baseball.
Fenway Park.
You know, I’d like to go there some time.
How often in a year
did you take Diane to a baseball game?
Diane wasn’t interested in sports.
She never wanted to go to a game? Ever?
I don’t recall her ever asking.
Just out of curiosity, Fenway, that’s a tough ticket.
Where do you get yours?
EVELYN: My husband has season tickets.
And how long has he had them?
30 years.
But I’ve only been married to him for 20.
And Diane never went to one game?
What color was the dress Diane wore to prom?
Diane didn’t attend a prom
because she didn’t go to a high school.
No prom.
What sports did she play?
As I told you earlier,
she wasn’t interested in sports.
Did she go to camp during the summer?
EVELYN: No.
Community swimming pool?
We had our own pool.
Girl Scouts?
No.
Then what did she do with all that time?
She loved mathematics. It was her passion.
She preferred it to all other things.
All other?
Mrs. Adler, who’s Paul Riva?
(SCOFFS)
He was a boy from the neighborhood.
CULLEN: Oh, come on. He was much more than…
just a boy from the neighborhood.
Paul was Diane’s first love…
wasn’t he?
I wouldn’t characterize it that way. No.
CULLEN: And how would Diane characterize it?
Diane was 17 years old at the time.
She didn’t know anything about love.
CULLEN: Mrs. Adler…
in January of 1998…
didn’t Diane and young Mr. Riva run away together?
He coerced her.
And where did they go?
Vermont.
And you called the police, didn’t you?
Because he kidnapped her?
Yes. Yes.
And where did the police find young Mr. Riva and Diane?
I told you. Vermont.
Stowe, Vermont. Wasn’t it?
A resort town.
Stowe Mountain.
He took her skiing.
You see, kidnappers don’t usually
take their victims skiing.
But this is what Paul did…
because he and Diane were in love.
No.
And when they returned,
you pressed kidnapping charges.
You filed a lawsuit against his parents…
until Paul stopped calling Diane.
Didn’t you?
Yes.
And Diane never heard from or saw Paul Riva again.
Did she?
Not to my knowledge.
And how did she take it?
She was upset for a while.
She lost focus.
She lost focus.
Mrs. Adler, in March of 1999…
didn’t Diane Adler attempt to take her own life?
This episode was minor. It was nothing.
I have the hospital report in my hand.
It was nothing.
Diane was not like regular people.
She was extraordinary.
And extraordinary people
come with singular issues and needs.
You have no idea the capability she possessed.
One in a billion.
And you would say, “Fine, let’s throw that away…
“so the boy who cuts our yard can make a sexual conquest.”
Maybe before you make that decision,
you stand in my shoes.
I had responsibilities which went beyond
the mother-daughter relationship.
The greatest discoveries
which have improved life on this planet…
have come from minds rarer than radium.
Without them, we’d still be crawling in mud.
And for your information, counselor…
a year after this incident with this boy…
Diane thanked me for my intervention.
She realized she’d made a mistake and she thanked me.
You see, Diane understood she was accountable
for the gift she’d been given.
And she didn’t shy from it.
And I think, if she were here today, Mr. Attorney…
she would refute your baseless insinuations…
that she would give up her brilliant future
and take her own life…
just because Mommy didn’t get her a little red wagon.
No more questions.
(INAUDIBLE)
HIGHSMITH: Mr. Adler…
where are you currently employed?
I repair boats.
Oh, really? At which marina?
I don’t work at a marina. I freelance.
So, safe to say, no health insurance.
No.
HIGHSMITH: About a week before your sister took her life…
what were you doing for a living then?
I was a teacher.
HIGHSMITH: You’re being modest, aren’t you?
You were a professor at Boston University…
isn’t that right?
Yes, well, Assistant Professor.
And what’d you teach?
Philosophy.
Truth and logic. That sort of thing.
Your attorney said that the primary reason…
that you took Mary is because it was what your sister…
would have wanted you to do. Is that the truth?
Yes.
So Diane had visited Pinellas County before?
No.
Indicated she wanted her daughter
uprooted and moved here?
No.
No.
So, you decided to bring Mary here, didn’t you?
Did Diane have a problem
with your health plan at Boston University?
Not to my knowledge.
Do you think she would want her daughter
to have access to healthcare?
Of course.
So what do you do, when little Mary gets sick?
You repair a doctor’s boat?
Objection.
NICHOLS: Sustained.
Mary has been identified…
as a math prodigy.
But her formal math education under your care…
she’s learning at the first grade level, isn’t she?
FRANK: Yes.
HIGHSMITH: And you turned down a scholarship at the Oaks…
a school specializing in the education of gifted children?
Yes.
And Diane, she’d be fine with that?
I couldn’t say.
HIGHSMITH: Prior to Mrs. Adler giving her one,
did Mary have a computer?
She used mine.
Mr. Adler, does Diane’s daughter have her own bedroom?
FRANK: No.
HIGHSMITH: Does she sleep in a bed that you bought…
in a secondhand shop?
Yes.
So, the truth is, Mr. Adler,
that you didn’t come down here
because your sister wanted you to…
and you certainly didn’t come here
because it was good for Mary.
No, it was personal.
Diane was a star. You weren’t.
Diane got the attention. You didn’t.
And over the years, you got angry.
And here comes Mary.
What a great way to get even.
(SIGHS)
You’ve uprooted that little girl
and brought her here for one reason only.
To do harm to your mother.
You blamed her for your sister.
No, I don’t.
And Mary to you is just a pawn in all this. Isn’t she?
Diane wanted Mary…
to be a kid.
She wanted her to have a life.
She wanted her to have friends…
and to play…
and to be happy.
Do you realize the consequences
of boredom for a gifted child, Mr. Adler?
They become resentful and sullen.
Mary’s not an angry kid.
HIGHSMITH: Really?
Did she not attack a child on the school bus?
FRANK: A 12-year-old tripped
a 7-year-old and she came to his defense.
Did she break the boy’s nose?
Yes.
On October 16th of last year were you arrested for assault?
Oh, my God.
NICHOLS: You have to answer the question, Mr. Adler.
A drunk idiot attacked me and I defended myself.
What does that have to do with anything?
Did you spend the night in jail?
Yeah.
You are in way over your head here.
You’re depriving that girl.
You’re gambling with her future…
and now you’re being presented with an opportunity…
to do right by her. Jump at it.
CULLEN: Does counsel have a question for my client?
Take the high road, Mr. Adler…
before she is irreparably damaged.
CULLEN: Does counsel have a question…
for my client or not?
Yes, sir.
I do have the question.
Tell us, is your continued guardianship…
really in the best interest of this little girl?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
HIGHSMITH: I have no further questions.
MARY: Research and Development…
has come up with a brand new Fred cheer.
Fred personally asked me if I would tell you it.
Let’s hear it.
S-O-C-K I-T Sock it to me, Freddy…
Sock it.
(VOCALIZING)
Sock it.
(VOCALIZING)
Tell R and D, they got a winner.
That’s exactly what I said.
MARY: S-O-C-K I-T Sock it to me, Freddy
CULLEN: They wanna cut a deal.
Highsmith called me first thing this morning.
Why would he do that? I don’t understand.
In the middle of…
Just listen. Listen to me, man.
Mary would be put in a fostering situation.
No.
Come on, Frank.
Cullen, I told you no.
It wouldn’t be a court-appointed
foster family, Frank.
Hey! Drop it!
We could cherry-pick…
from the cream of the crop.
Mutually approved.
Just hear me out.
Tampa.
I insisted, and they agreed.
No more than a half an hour from your front door.
Now, she would attend the Oaks.
It’s a great school.
And visiting rights for the grandmother…
but she was gonna get that anyway.
Right? And on her 12th birthday, Frank,
she can go back into court…
No.
and decide then…
where she wants to live and with who.
I don’t understand this.
I thought you were supposed to be on my team.
Why are you bringing me this deal?
Other than I’m required to by law?
You like this deal?
I love this deal.
They think they’re gonna lose.
Yeah.
They do.
You think we’re gonna lose.
Yes.
I do, Frank.
(CULLEN EXHALES)
I gotta go put my kids to bed.
I’ll do whatever you want me to do.
But if we leave this up to that judge, Nichols…
he’s old school, Frank.
Does he like your mother? No.
Does he like her income?
Does he like her health plan? Does he like her home?
You better believe it.
I’ve been in his courtroom.
A hundred times.
And if it’s a coin toss…
Look at me.
If it’s a coin toss…
that old boy is going to side with the money.
So, do me a favor, Frank.
Just meet the family. See how it feels.
It’s all I ask.
WOMAN: (SINGING) Fly away, little pretty bird
Fly, fly away…
Pool. Florida.
That dock is on the Intercoastal.
Which I guess is obvious…
since we’re on the Intercoastal.
Added this desk, so she could do her homework.
Yeah.
And this would be her room.
I see in your eyes a promise
So, while I’m trying to sell you on the house…
and us…
I just don’t want you to think
that we’re completely insensitive…
to what you’re feeling.
You guys gonna be okay with a cat?
Absolutely.
Love’s own tender flames
Warm this meeting
And love’s tender song you will sing
But fly away…
I’ve been thinking a lot about the word “compromise.”
On one hand, good challenging school…
on the other…
foster people.
They can watch sitcoms with her.
Take her to Olive Garden.
Teach her to say “irregardless.”
The only saving grace, I suppose,
is she’s better off than she was.
Well…
Goodbye, Frank.
(SIGHS) Hey…
come on.
I’m only 25 minutes away.
(CRYING) Please don’t leave me here.
Please.
No.
Look, you’re going to
a brand new school, a better school.
I don’t want to.
I want my crummy school.
And you got Fred.
Please.
And once a month you can come back.
You can stay with me and Roberta.
I want you and Roberta now!
And in a few years, if you want…
you can come back. You can live with me.
I wanna stay with you.
Frank, you promised me.
Come on. Don’t do this.
You promised me.
I know.
I know.
Please, Frank. Why are you leaving me?
Because the court said I had to. You know this.
We’ve discussed this ad naus…
We’ve discussed this. Come on.
Come on, please.
No!
Hey, Mary.
No!
Hey, Mary.
No! No!
Sweetheart, you know what?
No!
There’s no easy way to do this.
Not gonna be as long as you think, honey.
Frank!
You’re gonna see.
MARY: Frank!
Don’t leave me!
I know this is hard.
Please!
No! Get your hands off of me!
Frank! Please!
I know it’s hard.
Come back!
Mary! I know.
No!
Frank!
Don’t go!
I need you!
Fred needs you!
(STARTS ENGINE)
You promised me!
No!
(SIGHS) Huh.
BONNIE: Hey, down there.
FRANK: I don’t know which mistake is worse.
Designing a water pump that leaks…
or putting it somewhere no human being can reach.
(FRANK GRUNTS)
How do you design something you know is gonna fail?
Gotta be devious or clueless, right?
After the first few weeks, I knew…
I had to find a real family for her.
I was in way over my head.
And every day, I’d say, “Today’s the day…
“I’m takin’ her to child services.”
And every day, she’d do something just…
so unbelievably cool.
Her little personality was exploding.
She was funny.
And she was angry, and she was happy, and she was…
sad.
And was cute.
Just so damn entertaining.
And so I kept her.
Not that that’s in her best interest.
Not that I’m capable of raising a child.
A child that might still have a mother…
if I had taken the time to notice that she needed me.
(GRUNTS)
And now, six and a half years later…
I finally got her to the foster family,
and you know what?
It was great. She loved it.
I thought it would be a nightmare…
of abandonment and betrayal.
But, turns out it was a huge success.
I’m a fucking hero.
(CRASHING)
Frank…
No, Bonnie.
I appreciate everything you’ve done.
Just…
Hey.
Hi, Frank.
We’re having a little bit of a problem in there.
What?
Uh, Mary’s fine…
but she’s having a little bit of a meltdown.
Right. Let me talk to her.
No, hang on.
That’s not a good idea.
Your visit here is the reason for the meltdown.
What?
She don’t wanna see you.
I’m sorry, man.
This is predictable.
You know, she needs time.
Just give me five minutes with her.
I let you inside…
then we’re gonna betray her trust
and we have an even bigger problem.
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
Oh…
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
Hi.
Hi! Can we help you?
Yeah. Do you have a one-eyed orange cat named Fred?
We have a one-eyed cat,
but I don’t know what his name is.
Where?
I don’t know. Today was his last day.
Hey, you can’t go back there.
(DOG BARKING)
Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing back here?
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
(CAT MEOWS)
I told him he couldn’t.
(SIGHS)
Hey, Fred.
(MEOWS)
Who brought this cat in?
Some guy. He said it was an allergy issue.
(SIGHS)
Evelyn.
(CATS MEOWING)
Frank!
Where’s Evelyn?
Evelyn? You mean your mother?
Yes.
Kevin.
Evelyn is in the guest house.
Yeah, listen. I’m sorry, man.
Frank, let me tell you,
she was so helpful with the tutors.
Mary was so distant.
Hey!
Look, we know what you’re up against.
Do you want your life back?
Go back inside.
What are you doing here?
Come on, Mary. We’re goin’ home.
No.
You’re trespassing!
You need to look at this.
Let’s go, Mary.
Let’s move. Come on.
No!
Hey! Mary.
Mary!
Mary!
It’s okay. I got her.
Uh-uh!
Think again, lady.
Mary!
Mary! Hey, stop it.
No! Let me go!
No!
No! No!
Stop, Mary!
Stop. Stop.
No!
Come here.
You lied to me!
I know!
No! No!
Stop! Stop, stop!
(SOBBING)
I’m sorry.
I made a mistake. I’m so sorry.
You promised me.
I know.
You promised.
I know. I’m sorry.
You said you wouldn’t leave me.
I made a mistake.
(SIGHS) I’m sorry.
I was so sad!
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
They took Fred.
No. It’s okay.
I got him. He’s home.
What?
He’s at the apartment right now. I got him.
For real?
Yeah. He’s home kicking around his ping pong ball.
Why did you leave me there?
Because I thought I was bad for you.
And then it dawned on me.
If Mary is this amazing…
smart, sweet human being…
then I must be doing something right.
(CRYING)
You’re smiling.
(LAUGHS TEARFULLY)
Roberta!
(ROBERTA CHUCKLES)
Oh, baby.
Of all the stunts you could pull.
Where are they going?
Nowhere.
Not yet.
You two, out!
What is this?
Do you want to know…
how Diane told me she finished?
What is this unconscionable lie?
I walked into her apartment
and she was sitting on the floor…
with that baby in her arms
and you know what she said to me?
Admit it. You made this up.
She said, “What do I do now?”
No.
It is not a completed proof…
It is.
No! It isn’t! It can’t be.
Evelyn, stop!
I’m taking Mary and I’m raising her
how I believe Diane would’ve wanted.
We’ll see about that later.
I realize…
she’s not normal.
But if Einstein can ride a bike, so can she.
Let’s just say Diane didn’t tell me, which is nonsense…
it’s a Millennium Problem.
She would have shared it with the world.
That’s where your charade falls apart.
If she had completed the proof,
she would have published it.
Diane instructed me very clearly.
That I was only to publish it postmortem.
She died six years ago.
It wasn’t her death she was talking about.
I tried to talk her out of it.
But you know how Diane could be
when she made her mind up about something.
I called MIT.
Shankland’s out of his mind
about the possibility of publishing it with you.
He’s waiting for your call.
You’re gonna be spending the next few years of your life…
defending it.
You won’t have time for her.
What if I say no?
Back to Plan A.
Wait for me to die?
I know Diane was hard.
I know she was angry.
But something really good came out of this, Evelyn.
She needs you now.
You’re the best woman for the job.
Take it.
It doesn’t seem as though Diane wanted me to have it.
Diane didn’t always think things through.
I’ll be outside.
Let me know what you wanna do.

RECEPTIONIST 1: (ON RECORDING) You’ve reached
the Department of Mathematics at MIT.
If you know your party’s extension,
you may dial it at any time.
(SOBBING)
If you wish to speak to an operator…
please stay on the line
and someone will be with you as soon as possible.
RECEPTIONIST 2: Good afternoon, MIT Mathematics,
how may I direct your call?
Hello? I’m sorry. I can’t hear you very well.
No! No.
Yeah. There you are.
Yeah, can I help you?
Uh, yes.
Doctor Shankland.
I’m really sorry. I can’t hear you.
Could you speak up, please?
Hello?
Evelyn Adler…
for Seymore Shankland, please.
PROFESSOR: And what I want you to notice,
is that when you compute P of N…
for N congruent to four mod five…
the answer is a multiple of five.
So, the first person to notice this
was Srinivasa Ramanujan.
In the beginning of the 20th century…
he proved that it was the case for all…
numbers congruent to four mod five.
So, he proved that P of five N plus four…
is congruent to zero mod seven…
and that P of eleven N plus six
is congruent to zero mod eleven.

What’s it about?
Existence.
Existence?
Yup. “I think, therefore I am.”
Well, of course you are.
That’s obvious.

I think about Fred, therefore, I am.
Cogito ergo Fred?
He’s a dude and he’s a guy.
And he only has one eye.
Fred, Fred, Fred!

Joining us now is Matt. He’s a certified DEI expert.
And, Matt, let’s start with what you do.
What is a certified DEI expert?
Well, that’s someone who takes you on a journey of diversity and inclusion.
And, um, speaking of journeys, you know, And, um, speaking of journeys, you know, it’s all about how you begin the journey.
We covered this in the workshop.
I’d like to start with what’s called a “land acknowledgement.”
I don’t know if you’re familiar with those.
Um, I brought, uh, one along for this broadcast.




Uh, so, I’d like to begin by acknowledging that this broadcast is airing in the traditional lands of the Ute, the Paiute, the Goshute, and the Shoshone tribes.
These are the peoples who call this land home before it was ravaged and ransacked by the white man.
And this is a lot of things that we don’t necessarily think about. that we don’t necessarily think about.
MATT: Mm-hmm.
And this is part of the journey that you’d like to teach other folks in your workshops.
Yeah.
If you wouldn’t mind, I’d go through the exercise right now.
Uh…
Go ahead. What is it?
So, can we all do it together?
Yeah. Do we stand?
Yeah. Yeah, we stand for it.
Okay.
Okay.
It’s very, very simple. I start every day like this.
So what you’re doing is you’re stretching, you’re stretching, and this is more for you and less for you.
You’re stretching up like this, and you’re stretching out.
Mm-hmm.
What you’re doing is you’re stretching out of your whiteness.
Okay, so you’re decentering your whiteness. Okay, so you’re decentering your whiteness.
You’re stretching out of your whiteness.
You’re probably wondering if this is real.
The answer is yes. It’s real.
That’s me. Matt Walsh. In real life.
With the man bun and the skinny jeans on an actual news show as a certified DEI expert.




If you don’t know,
DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion.
It’s all the rage right now.
But you’re still probably asking, what am I doing on this TV show?
How did I get there?
And how did I become a certified DEI expert?
Well, it’s a complicated story.
[FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING]
I’ve been a white guy my whole life.
Growing up in the ’90s,
I never thought much about race.
I mean, yeah, sure,
you noticed if somebody was Black
or white or Mexican, or whatever,
but it never really seemed to matter that much.
At least not to me.
And we think the vast majority of Americans are racist?
That’s what I’m trying… I totally understand.
I think that there is a significant portion,
um, that are racist
and you can’t…
MATT: These days, though,
we’re told that racial tensions are high.
It’s all over the media.
There are a lot of racists in this country.




MAN: We’re doing a big story about race in America.
Race in America.
KAMALA HARRIS: Black, Latino,
and Indigenous people are suffering and dying…
Violent, white supremacy.
White…
White…
White entitlement.
This is America.
REPORTER: Overnight growing national unrest.
We’ve gotta do the work.
Coffee?
Yes. Thank you.
How do you take it?
[TENSE MUSIC BUILDS]
[MUSIC STOPS]
Black.
That was awkward.
Should I not have said “black”?
That’s how I like my coffee.
I don’t like cream. Is that so wrong?
I don’t think the two should be mixed.
Okay, that does sound racist.
Wait, am I racist?
What is racism?




If I’m gonna sort this out, I need to talk to an expert.
Preferably someone outside of my bubble.
Somebody who can speak with authority
about the Black experience in America.
Or I’ll just talk to this white woman.
This is Kate Slater.
She’s an anti-racist scholar and educator.
Hi. Nice…
Nice to meet ya. How are ya?
And you are the co-creator
of something called the Anti-Racist
Roadmap.
Roadmap. Yeah.
So, what… what is that?
After 2020, we saw
a lot of white people saying,
“Okay, I know I need to do the work,
“but I don’t know what the work is.”
So what is the work?
[CHUCKLES DRILY]
‘Cause I wanna do…
The work.
Do that.
I wanna do it too, but I don’t know what…
What is the work?
I think, for white folks, the work is
reallocating our resources and privileges
to balance out systemic inequities.
So that means there is a white person who says,
“Okay, I’m ready to interrupt racism,”
or, “I’m gonna be really nice
“to that Black or brown person,”
because that’s the work.
But they’re never willing to interrupt
their shitty racist uncle.
That’s a powerful example for me.
You mentioned a racist uncle.
[LAUGHS] I’ve got one, too.
Yeah.
Well, you’re saying,
sometimes we have to confront those people.
Oh, absolutely.
Because if you’re not going to confront them, who is?
When is the right age to talk to our kids
about their racism?
Before they can talk. [LAUGHING]
I mean it. I…
So my six-month-old baby, I used…
Why the hell not? Why the hell not?
My six-month-old…




And honestly, they’ve gone through six months of life,
I’ve never talked to them about racism.
So my daughter’s four years old.
I am an anti-racist educator, quote-unquote.
She’s still watching Disney movies,
and she is choosing a white princess over
princesses of color.
Have you talked to her about that?
All the time.
My three-year-old daughter is very…
Her favorite princess is Moana.
Love it.
It’s a good sign.
Yeah.
But then I also thought,
you know, it’s a little bit of cultural appropriation here.
She wants to be Moana for Halloween.
Mm-hmm.
So, how do we navigate that?
[SIGHS]
Do I go and buy
the Pacific Islander native attire
for my white three-year-old?
Um, I wouldn’t. I [BLEEP] wouldn’t.
But I guess, what we might call the Moana problem here
is what, uh, on one hand, is cultural appropriation.
On the other hand,
there’s gravitating towards white characters.
Right.
So it’s almost like
no matter which way you go,
you end up back…
Right.
…in racism.
We think every space belongs to us
because we live in a white supremacist society.
Is America an inherently racist country?
I think the word “inherent” is challenging there.
If we say…
Fundamentally.
Fundamentally, yes.
America is racist to its bones.
All of the…
So, inherently.
Yeah.
Just to put it as bluntly as possible,
am I racist?
Every white person in America has grown up in a country
where race and racism make up the fabric of our society.
So I don’t think anyone moves through this world




with a non-bias, non-racist world view.
So the answer’s yes, I am racist.
You said it
What do you recommend to people for resources
if they’re just starting on their anti-racist path?
Go to the bookstore
if you’re not reading these books.
And then applying what you’ve learned,
taking what you read about and saying,
“Hey, racist uncle,
“I think we should talk about this.”
That you’re no good.
I’ve never, uh, confronted my own racist uncle.
I haven’t confronted him.
But it’s not ever too late.
No.
No.
Sometimes it means having the conversation
that you’ve been knowing in your heart,
you’ve been putting off for years.
MATT: Hmm.
If Kate Slater’s right, then it’s all worse than I thought.
America is racist down to its bones.
And my Uncle Frank,
well, I’ll deal with him later.
For now, I’ve got a lot of reading to do.
[LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC PLAYING]
So we do have books on anti-racism,
uh, kind of all throughout the store.
There’s a lot of, like, newer stuff
that tends to go on the main floor first, but…
Yeah.
…the bulk of our section,
we keep over here.
This is all anti-racism?
Yeah. This section is really just books on anti-racism,
and a lot of the history of racism,
particularly in the United States.
Am I even allowed to touch this one?
Some of these books are provocative.
WOMAN: Yes. Definitely. [CHUCKLES]
So, what… Am I allowed to even read this one?
WOMAN: I think you’re allowed to read it.
I would not perhaps say the title. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]
So I couldn’t call you up and say, “Do you have…”
You might say it’s a book that starts with “N”
and it’s by this author.
Yeah.
If you were looking for that in particular.
That’s probably a level up
from where I am.
[LAUGHS]
How many of these do you think we need to…
need to get through before we can really understand?
Start with one book, let it sit, see how you feel.
I feel like reading one book kind of gets you
into a place where it’s like,
“You know what? I do want to do more about this.”
These are all staff recommendations.
Uh, they’re all fiction, written by diverse authors,
and they’re all pretty fun.
Dumb question. You said diverse authors.
What’s a diverse person?
Uh, that would be basically people who aren’t white,
[CHUCKLES] essentially.
So, Black, Latinx…
So we can’t…
…Native American, Asian…
So everybody who’s not white is diverse.
Well…
Unless you’re… say, gay.
Yeah. I mean,
it’s not just reading Black people, but, you know,
every… Like, there are a lot of different groups
that have faced persecution, and have had a hard time,
and, you know, just being a white,
straight, cisgender person, usually a man,
it’s like kind of the top of the pile.
But, uh…
That’s me.
[LAUGHS]
So I’m on the top of the pile.
Uh… You know…
Where should I start?
White Women , uh,
by Regina Jackson and Saira Rao.
Race 2 Dinner is a thing that they do, uh…
Basically, this book is saying, like,
“We need to stop being nice about racism,”
’cause nothing has been advanced by being nice.
White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo.
Hearing from another white person
about ways to have these conversations,
and ways to break through your own white fragility,
I think, is a really good place to start.
Well, a lot to learn,
but we have all the materials here,
I think…
[CHUCKLES]
…to start the journey.
[INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING]
Beautiful bookstore.
Thank you. We’re fond of it.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING]
MAN: Robin DiAngelo’s 2018 book, White Fragility,
catapulted to the top
o f the New York Times best sellers’ list.
GAYLE KING: Robin DiAngelo is a sociologist,
and she’s author of this book.
Everyone, please check out her book, White Fragility.
Everyone else in the world has.
White Fragility, which is, in many cases,
the Bible for white people…
This is the book that we’ll be reading.
White Fragility.
Crucial and seminal book.
WOMAN: New York Times best-selling list
for the third year.
MATT: “Racism is the norm rather than an aberration.
“Anti-Blackness is foundational
“to our very identities as white people.”
DIANGELO: As a white person,
I was just raised to expect the world to be mine.
That’s how difficult we are.
Wow.
That’s how big, uh, a-holes we are. [LAUGHS]
Yeah.
MATT: “White identity is inherently racist.
“White people do not exist
“outside the system of white supremacy.”
When we say “I’m not racist,” what we’re conveying
is that we’re clueless about what racism is.
And I would just ask white Americans
to remove that phrase from their vocabulary.
“I’m not racist.”
MATT: “Anger, fear, and guilts,
“and behavior such as argumentation silence
“and withdrawal. These responses work to
“maintain our dominance within the racial hierarchy.
“I conceptualize this process as white fragility.”
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Robin DiAngelo was right.
Coming to terms with my whiteness
was not going to be easy.
Fortunately, I found a support group
that can help me with my white privilege,
run by an anti-racist expert who specializes in grief.
Her fee was $30,000 to host this workshop,
so, obviously, she must be the best.
But I’m worried that, as a well-known conservative,
the support group may not welcome me into their fold.
Maybe I’ll use a different name
to help me blend in.
Whatever it takes to continue this journey.
WADE: All right. So, typically, I like
to open up the space with a brief meditation,
so if you feel comfortable,
please ground yourself in your seats.
Close your eyes
and just allow yourself to be fully present in the space.
Whatever that means.
Are we meditating?
Okay. Sorry.
When you are ready, open your eyes
and rejoin the space.
All right. So is everybody excited
to talk about anti-racism and grief?
Absolutely.
[ALL LAUGHING]
WADE: Okay.
So, I usually like to get this started
by just introducing ourselves.
If you could please pronounce your name. If you could please pronounce your name.
Uh, please share your pronouns,
how you’re feeling today,
as well as the weirdest compliment
you have ever received.
My name is Dan. Uh, my pronouns are he/him.
I’m feeling excited today.
And then the weirdest compliment
I think I’ve ever received…
I was in the online dating sphere,
and I’ve gotten the “you look much better in person.”
[ALL LAUGHING]
Oh, my God.
Um…
If you wanna stand, you can,
totally, it’s okay.
Okay, I’ll just sit down.
Uh, I’m Steven.
Uh, pronouns, I’ll… Uh, pronouns, I’ll…
you know, I’ll have to get back to you on that.
Um, I’m feeling excited, uh, nervous.
WADE: Mm-hmm.
Uh, present.
A little hungry. [CHUCKLES] But…
The strangest compliment I’ve ever gotten
is I’ve been complimented, uh,
on the number of Black friends that I have…
WADE: Hmm. MATT: …in the past.
So, it’s 17, um…
it’s a number, but, you know…
Sometimes it comes up, but, um…
That’s what people have said, so…
WADE: Hmm.
Thank you, everybody,
for being willing to participate
and for, first and foremost, being here.
We will not end systemic racism.
It is not possible for us to dismantle a system
that has been around for 400 years,
and has effectively and efficiently
destroyed the lives of millions of people.
You all have been grandfathered into the system.
We are here to focus on you
and your experience and your grief
because that is the source
of downstream anti-Blackness and racism. of downstream anti-Blackness and racism.
And quite frankly, I pray to God
you all feel this uncomfortable.
I will be so happy if you all feel extremely uncomfortable,
if you are truly looking at what white supremacy
has done to not only, um,
African Americans, but to yourselves.
You are here to sit amidst whatever suffering
and pain you are experiencing
for the sake of the liberation of others.
That is love.
I don’t know if any of you grew up
with a Christian background. I did. with a Christian background. I did.
[CHUCKLES] Uh…
But love is also not always patient and kind.
When we are talking about systemic oppression,
and the role that we are playing to mitigate it,
patience is not needed.
People are dying.
Kindness is not what is called for.
We are here to talk about the fact
that Black Americans are not safe.
If I’m going to be quite frank,
when I do this work, and these types of circles,
I’m not safe.
But I do them out of necessity.
Why are you…
Why are you not safe in the circle?
Being an African American
in primarily white spaces is not safe for me mentally
or emotionally.
We will go into more depth about that,
but I appreciate that question.
These topics may be difficult, and at times,
you may feel overcome by emotions. That’s okay.
There is a room to the left.
If you find that your emotions are, um,
interfering with the group process,
I kindly ask you to step aside.
Um, so can we start with you? Um, so can we start with you?
I’m here because…
I feel like I’ve been socialized to be an asshole,
and that doesn’t feel good.
And my promise to the Black community
is to lean into
being brave and uncomfortable,
and to love in inconvenient ways.
Thank you.
Well, I’m here on a journey towards
a brighter future, uh, for myself
and for, you know, hopefully, the world. and for, you know, hopefully, the world.
My promise to myself is love.
To love myself.
Which is so important,
and I’ve struggled so much with that.
[SNIFFLES]
I’ve struggled so much with it
in my life, to find myself. Um…
My promise to the Black communities…
[SIGHS] to be so much better.
So much better than I have been to them.
To be better in so many better ways.
To better myself. To better the world. To better myself. To better the world.
And I know that I haven’t been better.
I haven’t been.
But I’m going to be.
That’s my promise.
WADE: Thank you.
Oh.
I am here with the intention
to understand
and learn and, um… and learn and, um…
dig a little bit into…
I’m sorry, can I…
I forgot one other thing I wanted to promise
the Black community.
Um…
It’s really important that we don’t interrupt
each other during the group.
Oh, I’m sorry.
But I appreciate…
I have one other promise for the Black…
We can circle back around.
Thank you.
Are we going to circle back around?
No. No. Uh…
Other things will come up. That’s part of the process.
But I want to be very sure
that we respect everybody’s time.
Okay. I didn’t want someone else to take my promise
to the Black community that I was gonna make.
Well, thank you. Please continue.
The promise that I am making to myself The promise that I am making to myself
is to be elastic.
To use my voice and my privilege,
to be heard.
Uh, to…
That’s what I was gonna say, but…
Please allow her to finish.
Sorry.
If we think about the construction of whiteness
as an identity,
it makes sense that the seeds of white supremacy
are buried within your subconscious,
whether or not you realize it, and without your consent.
It is often uncommon for white Americans
to be aware of their privilege, to be aware of their privilege,
let alone how it’s functioning on a day-to-day basis.
You said, a moment ago…
Um, there’ll be an oppor…
Can I say something?
Uh, yes. Ask a question.
You said, a moment ago,
that the seeds of white supremacy
are in all of us.
Yes.
How do we get them out?
That’s what the presentation…
We’re going through the presentation to discuss that.
If there is another interruption,
I’m going to have to respectfully ask you
to step out and go to the second room to the left.
But next time, I am gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
Leave for good?
Just until you’re able to rejoin the group
and participate without interruption.
Yeah?
That’s fair.
Okay. Thank you.
[EXHALES LOUDLY]
White supremacy has essentially created a system
driven by grief,
and that is why we are here to discuss
white grief in particular.
I would like you to close your eyes
and spend the next 30 seconds
thinking about,
what does that loss feel like in your body? what does that loss feel like in your body?
It feels like a thousand knives
plunging into my soul.
And a sack being…
hit by bats and bricks.
And the whole sack is thrown into the ocean.
Thank you.
That’s what it feels like.
And it’s very… it’s…
Oh, um…
What?
We’re moving to her now.
I… I didn’t finish. I… I didn’t finish.
Please finish.
MATT: Um…
The sack’s thrown into the ocean,
then the sack’s taken out,
and it’s set on fire.
[MATT SMACKS LIPS]
Thank you.
That’s what it feels like.
I have spent a lot of time in primarily white spaces.
For better or worse. [LAUGHS] So…
And that has come with a cost.
How long will it take until
the next microaggression comes up?
These are things that I carry every time These are things that I carry every time
I am in a room with primarily white people.
You’re safe here.
I think I speak for all of us when I say,
in this room…
WADE: I…
One more interruption…
White folks.
…I’m gonna have to ask you to step out again.
Okay. I just wanted to reassure you.
WADE: Thank you. I appreciate that.
I just want to.
Thanks.
So, what do you feel in your body
when you hear the term “white people”?
I feel, like, a cringe about it.
“Cringe” is a good word.
WADE: Cringe? Yeah?
I couldn’t pick a word,
WADE: Cringe? Yeah?
I couldn’t pick a word,
but that’s a very good one.
WADE: Okay.
As soon as you asked the question, I felt,
inside, like a gut…
a little bit of a poke. “Ugh.”
And I think it’s for all of the reasons,
but also a little anger…
WADE: Mm-hmm.
…at whiteness as, um, that lie.
Just, “ugh!”
WADE: Mm-hmm. Thank you.
[MATT SNICKERS]
[MUMBLES]
WADE: The thing about…
I’m gonna step out for a moment.
Thank you. Appreciate that.
The thing about…
MATT: Which one is the cry room? MATT: Which one is the cry room?
The second door to the left.
Thank you.
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]
MATT: My time in the cry room
allowed me some much-needed reflection and self-care,
but with me out of the room,
the group put two and two together and realized
who I actually was.
Not a guy named Steven.
When I finally returned,
things were drastically different.
When I do this work, the, uh, white participants
in the group feel that there’s something in themselves in the group feel that there’s something in themselves
that they have to overcome.
[DOOR OPENS]
When all that’s
being requested of you…
[CLEARS THROAT]
…is that you be.
Hello.
MATT: Hi.
WADE: How are you?
Sorry about that.
Oh, no problem.
You good?
Yeah.
Remind me of your name again?
Uh… Uh, Steven.
Steven? Yeah? Okay.
Um…
Did you want to come up?
Come up?
Yeah. Do you wanna come up and share anything?
Sure. What do you want me to share? Sure. What do you want me to share?
Whatever’s on your mind.
I just want to know that, like, my physical safety
and yours and everybody else’s here is okay.
Why would your physical safety not be okay?
Did I miss something?
I don’t feel comfortable.
What… Can you guys
catch me up to speed on what’s going on here?
You don’t need to be caught up.
We’re gonna be silent.
Is it because I said I had 17 Black friends?
It might have been 15. I…
It depends on how you count them.
I would really appreciate it if you left,
so that the people who actually want to be here
and deserve to be here can get what they need.
I do want to be here.
Can you please leave?
I would like it if you left.
I’m trying to learn. I’m on this journey.
Come with me.
Well…
WADE: Thank you.
I didn’t… I didn’t consent to be touched.
I’m not offering to touch you.
I’m offering to walk you out.
Will you walk with me, and I’ll answer your questions?
Okay. I’ll admit it.
I’ll admit it. My name’s not Steven.
WADE: Hmm.
Maybe you already knew that.
My name is Matt Walsh. My name is Matt Walsh.
WADE: Mm-hmm
Mm-hmm. We know.
I just was here on this…
on this journey that I’m just starting, but…
I see that I’m not wanted.
If you were on your journey,
then you would’ve told us who you were
and your real name, but you didn’t.
Please leave.
Are you saying
I need a better disguise? Is that what you…
I don’t know. Maybe.
But you can figure that out as you walk out the door.
WOMAN 1: How did you get in here?
WOMAN 2: We all had an invitation.
Maybe.
Yeah. Maybe.
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]
MATT: Thank you so much.
I really had a transformative experience myself. I really had a transformative experience myself.
And my pronouns are he/him.
[INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER]
I did everything I could to fit in.
I opened up.
I was raw and emotional.
I told them about my Black friends.
It was no use. They rejected me.
And they called the police.
My mere presence in the room caused them pain.

I’ll never be accepted if I look like this.
If they know that I’m Matt Walsh,
I’ll always be an outsider.
I need to go deeper undercover.
A whole new identity.
If I want to be an ally, I need to look like one.
Like someone who is progressive,
tolerant, enlightened.
Let me think.
Have I ever met anyone like that?
Ah, yes.
Yes, I have.
What is a woman?
Why do you ask that question?
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
[MUSIC FADING OUT]
It’s time to get serious about my anti-racist training.
And it’s not gonna be cheap.
Nice to meet you.
I’m Matt. How are you?
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I guess I’ll take my seat here.

I’m DEI certified. How are you?
DEI certified. I’m here to help.
DEI certified. If you need some help, let me know, sir.
I’m DEI certified.
What?
What?
Let me know if you need some help. I’m DEI certified.
Oh, good.
If you need any help, just let me know.
My name’s Matt. I am, uh, certified
in diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Just got my certification. Just got my certification.
Just letting you know I am DEI certified.
DEI certified.
What is DEI?
You’re in good hands here. I am qualified to have
these kinds of important dialogues.
So I guess I’ll start with,
where are you guys in your anti-racist journeys?
Just talk to me about, uh, decentering your whiteness
and where you are on that journey.
-“Decentering my whiteness.”
Yeah.
Why do I have to go away from my whiteness
and decentralize it?
I recently actually took a masters level course,
um, about inclusion and diversity. um, about inclusion and diversity.
Have you heard of DiversityAndInclusion.com?
I have not.
Couple of different prestigious institutions.
We all go to different schools, but go ahead.
There were some things that,
you know, kind of brought to my thought process
during that course that I had never…
Like what?
…thought about before.
Um, just about my own thinking.
When you start thinking about how you feel,
but you maybe don’t want to feel.
[CHUCKLES] Does that make sense?
It does make sense. What do you mean?
Um…
All I know is that, like,
I am white, and I am not racist. I am white, and I am not racist.
That’s how we, uh, deal with racism?
We just… We just say, “Oh, it’s not happening.”
Yeah, the more you talk about it,
the more you are blatantly acknowledging race.
And if you wanna forget it…
We have to acknowledge it.
You need to shut up about it.
I don’t want to forget about it.
It’s cool, like, you can flash your card all you want,
but you gotta be a real human at some point in your life.
Did you see the card?
I don’t give a damn
about your card, bro.
Let’s see it.
Look, we’re not gonna solve racism in this conversation,
but we can all agree
that you guys have some things to learn.
I feel like you’re the most racist person I feel like you’re the most racist person
I’ve ever talked to.
[CHUCKLES]
One of us got the license, the other one didn’t, so…
You just sound like a really racist person.
That I am. I’ve realized that.
I’ve been told that.
Why do you admit that?
Because denying it doesn’t make it go away.
We can’t all be certified experts.
[CHUCKLES]
I mean, I am,
but we can’t all be.
[BOTH LAUGH]
All right.
We’re still on a journey, all of us together.
Yeah.
That’s my motto.
I think you got some journeying to do.
MATT: I know I make this look easy,
but DEI work is harder than you think. but DEI work is harder than you think.
I still have a lot to learn.
A viral video from September
at ASU’s multi-cultural center ignited a firestorm.
What’d I do wrong?
WOMAN 1: You have a bag…
WOMAN 2: You’re… You’re offensive.
You’re making this space uncomfortable.
…uncomfortable.
WOMAN 2: But you’re white.
This white man thinks he can take up our space,
and this is why we need a multi-cultural space.
You are racist! Your sticker’s racist because
you can choose to be a cop,
you can choose to kill people with a badge,
and you’re protecting that shit, and you’re protecting that shit,
which means that you’re racist!
MATT: Meet the charming young lady from that video.
Sarra Tekola.
Founding member of Black Lives Matter, Phoenix.
She has a Ph.D. in Sustainability, which means
something really important, I’m sure.
She’s agreed to help me learn how to decolonize myself.
For a $1,500 fee, of course.
So let’s just get this kicked off.
I’m a white guy myself.
What’s up with white people?
Um, where do we start?
Let me reframe the question a little bit.
What’s wrong with white people? What’s wrong with white people?
A lot of it has to do with cognitive dissidence
which allows, um, white people
to feel okay about what happened.
There’s actually a lot of studies on Nazi doctors,
and how they were able to, um, live with themselves.
Um, and it’s not that much different than white Americans
or white people around the world, right?
It’s this splitting of the self.
And so, um,
you have this part of you that knows
that they did wrong, the shadow self, that they did wrong, the shadow self,
and that you have to split that.
And you have the other self that’s like,
“Oh, I didn’t do anything wrong.
“Racism? Why are you blaming me
“for what my ancestors did? It’s not my fault.”
Is racism inherent to whiteness?
I would say so.
I would say that we need to abolish whiteness.
It’s always been rooted in othering the other people
who don’t fit into whiteness,
but when we look at white culture,
the only thing about white culture
is buying things and stealing things.
How do I…
confront my shadow, my shadow self? confront my shadow, my shadow self?
Acknowledging the parts of you that are racist,
and then being able to unpack and unlearn those.
Could I say, if someone called me racist,
could I say, “Well, I’m not racist.”
“My shadow self is, but I’m not”?
It’s the splitting of the self.
Like I said in the beginning about Nazi doctors.
The fact that you have two selves is a problem.
The more that you can merge it together,
then you could be able to acknowledge these dark sides.
But I don’t want to merge it,
because the shadow self is racist,
so I don’t want to be merged, right? I want to…
separate.
No. You have to.
separate.
No. You have to.
Yeah, because, uh, the thing is,
when you don’t merge them together,
your shadow self is out here being racist,
and you’re not even aware of it,
because that self, right…
So I gotta pull him in. I gotta merge him with mine.
Yeah.
But then make it all…
Yeah.
…not racist.
Yes.
I’m wondering, where do I go from here as an individual
on this anti-racist journey?
You just know whose land you’re on.
Our existence as Americans
is predicated on other people’s suffering.
Learn about who is suffering Learn about who is suffering
because of our existence on… on this stolen land.
It is important to feel bad,
um, about what your ancestors did.
Embrace the pain.
Yes.
[DO THE WORK! BY BRYSON GRAY PLAYS]
MATT: To be a good ally, I need to be an activist.
Our nation is littered with relics from our racist past.
I’m on a mission to right historical wrongs.
I needed some help, so I asked Ben,
one of my 17 Black friends,
to join me on my quest to change the world. to join me on my quest to change the world.
We have a petition.
Uh, we’re hoping that maybe you’d be willing to sign it.
We have a petition. We want to rename
the George Washington Monument.
To?
MATT: To the George Floyd Monument.
Because, of course,
George Washington was a slave owner.
Yep.
And so in some ways,
this is symbolic. Symmetry, it’s George for George,
you might say. Would you mind signing?
I don’t see why not. I will.
Okay.
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah.
Oh, man. I love that.
We’re talking about painting it black.
We’re gonna raise it 30%,
um, increasing it in height.
Excuse me, sir.
Sir, we have a petition. Sir?
For historical inequities to redress…
Is there a Black person around here?
I would hug them and apologize to them
all day long for what happened.
There’s a Black person right here.
Does he not exist?
I’m sorry. I just didn’t look that direction.
Sounds like you’re in the habit of overlooking
marginalized communities.
Brother.
You are an American. I love you.
I’m sorry for what happened in the past. I really am.
Let’s just sign it and move on.
You don’t have an opinion, but you’ll sign it anyway?
If that’s what you’d like me to, I can help.
I would like you to.
I can help you guys out.
I would like you to.
I can help you guys out.
Yeah. Thank you so much.
Sign here?
Yes. Absolutely.
I think it’s a beautiful idea.
You think it’s a beautiful idea?
I do.
MATT: We’ve got an encouraging number of signatures so far.
We have a petition for the…
to redress historical inequities.
Would you mind signing it?
You will?
[CAR HORN HONKING]
Uh, we want to rename the George Washington Monument
to the George Floyd Monument.
[CAR HORN BLARES]
Thank you so much.
Would you be willing to?
I can’t agree with that.
Will you sign it?
No. [CHUCKLES]
So are you gonna erase all of them? So are you gonna erase all of them?
Yes.
No. [SNIFFS]
Can you sign it anyway?
Nope.
MATT: Getting people to agree
to change the George Washington Monument
to the George Floyd Monument seemed ambitious.
I’m pleasantly surprised
people are willing to erase our problematic history.

Basically, this book is saying, like,

Apparently, you just pay these ladies thousands of dollars

Generally, we will have the host just set up a room,

When a white woman starts crying,

people need to be concerned
with how they’re going to feed their families.

But they know they’re Black.
Do you know they’re Black?
Of course I do, and I like it. Good for them.

if you meet a Black person,
you want to forget that they’re Black.
But don’t forget that they’re Black.
Why would you want to forget that they’re Black?
Well, don’t. But also don’t.
Are they a friend?
Well, don’t. But also don’t.
Are they a friend?
Then you should embrace them being Black.
I think Black men should have pride in being Black.

I agree with the first part.

Do you have a wife?

You don’t have to give me the whole list,
but what are some ways
that you’re, um, confronting your whiteness? that you’re, um, confronting your whiteness?
My whiteness?
Yeah.
I get along good with Black people.
I used to have… I used to have a Black brother.
I called him my brother. He called me his brother.
Was he really your brother?
No, he wasn’t.
You were calling a Black man brother?
Yeah. I had more Black friends
living in Huntsville than I had white friends.
Really?
Yeah.
So that’s in your own life, but systemically…
Considering the way things is at now?
Yeah.
Just to summarize. But what do you think about Just to summarize. But what do you think about
this issue of heteronormativity
and how it intersects
with the broader structures of racism in society?
Huh?
I mean, ultimately, how do we get to a point of,
let’s say, racial harmony?
I don’t know.
But I’m just telling you what I said.
That’s a lot to think about on my own journey.
It’s good to talk to you.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, I’m a vegetarian as well.

What is that?
That’s a little bit of a sexist joke.
Well, you know. It is what it is.
What do you think about racism in society?
Is it… Do you think it’s a big problem?
I was born in 1960.
My dad, my uncle,
my granddaddy, were Klansmen.
It never affected me.
But you don’t… You’re not…
No.
…racist?
No.
…racist?
No. Not at all.
And how do you know?
How do either of you know that you’re…
Because I… I accept people as they are.
WOMAN: Exactly.
If you approach me as a human being,
then I’m gonna be a human being too.
We all bleed the same way.
What do you think about systemic racism?
Systemic? What the hell is that?
Is the system constructed in such a way
as to marginalize people of color?
You wanna do away with racism?
Quit labeling people as Black and white. Quit labeling people as Black and white.
WOMAN: Exactly.
But that’s colorblindness,
which is problematic.
If I meet you as a Black man, and you…
you approach me, I shake your hand.
We go in here, we have a conversation,
we have a beer or ride down the road on a motorcycle.
What the hell does your color got to do with it?
It’s all right here, bubba.

I don’t care what color they are.
You gotta treat each other right.
MATT: I was expecting these bikers
would be a bunch of racists.
And obviously, I was right.
These people haven’t even started
to decenter their whiteness.
Now I need to go deeper into the racist south,
so that I can talk to people of color
about their lived experience with racism.
I was in the drug game for 18 years of my life, man.

It can be kind of a racist country.
No. No, no, no.
Do you experience a lot of microaggressions out here?
Nah. Not out here.
No.
Well, what about the systemic issue?
Systemic…
What you mean by “systemic”?
Well, the whole country. The system.
The system is… You know, the system is racist.
Mm…
Not to me.
Not to you?
No. Not to me, man.
I don’t think about those things,
racism and all that stuff.
I’ve been reading a lot of books recently.
Robin DiAngelo, White Fragility, obviously.
Uh, been reading a lot of anti-racist literature. Uh, been reading a lot of anti-racist literature.
Mm-hmm. I don’t read them things.
What do you read?
The only thing I read is the Bible.
I got it in the car right there.
If you looked in my car,
you’ll see it right there on the seat.
So you haven’t read any Robin DiAngelo?
Uh, no. No, no. Robin DiAngelo, who is that?
Well, she’s a anti-racist, uh…
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.
…expert.
I never read them kind of books, man.
If I get a book like that,
I put it down. I don’t want it.
I got a couple copies in my car. I can give you one.
No. I don’t want it. I don’t want it. No. I don’t want it. I don’t want it.
I don’t want it. [LAUGHS]
No. ‘Cause that is not in my heart. No.
I’ve kind of been working on, uh, decentering my whiteness.
Oh, your whiteness? [CHUCKLES]
Aight now, baby. We all bleed the same thing, dude.
If I cut you right there, you will bleed just like me.
[LAUGHING]
I…
It’s just the color of your skin.
How do we get past all the, uh,
talk about racism and the…
Oh, we gotta love each other, like I said.
We have to love each other. We have to love each other.
That’s how you get past racism.
Well, it can’t be that simple.
Huh?
Is it that simple?
Well, yeah. I mean, to me.
[BLUEGRASS MUSIC PLAYS]
MATT: Something’s not right.
These people said the same thing as those bikers.
White supremacy is more pervasive
than I ever imagined.
I need to talk to someone
who has stared directly into the face of racism.
July 16th…
Mm-hmm.
…2022.
Mm-hmm.
Difficult day for you.
Very.
And for America.
The popular kids amusement park
apologized after a video went viral apologized after a video went viral
that appeared to show a costumed character
snubbing two Black girls.
Okay, you see the character coming,
high-fiving everybody as he goes down the street.
Gets to those two little girls.
And appears to just flat out say no,
and you see the little girls,
and their faces, and they’re heartbroken.
MATT: Meet Jodi Brown.
The mother who was victimized
at the hands of Rosita, the Sesame Street character.
She was reluctant to talk about the traumatic incident,
but for $50,000,
she was willing to tell her tragic story.
Now, you have described this moment as disgusting. Now, you have described this moment as disgusting.
Because I feel like if you are able to acknowledge
someone before my children and after my children,
you could’ve stopped two seconds just to say hello.
This was something targeted at your… you and your child.
It was a very intentional racist act.
We don’t want some explanation that, “Oh, the performer
“didn’t see these two young girls.”
Which one of them is in isolation today
from the harm that is being caused by this company.
So we’re gonna demand So we’re gonna demand
that they take care of any type of healthcare
or mental care expenses
that these children have realized.
And who is Rosita? Who’s in that costume?
Mel Gibson.
I think that person needs to be,
you know, held accountable.
Fired and held to account.
Absolutely fired.
Well, before you fire ’em,
teach ’em why they’re being fired.
[APPLAUSE]
WOMAN: And then let them go.
And then let them go.
How do we fix the endemic racism among mascots?
Mascots, I feel, like, need to be trained better. Mascots, I feel, like, need to be trained better.
Do you know who the employee is that was
in the costume?
No.
That information was never given to me.
Uh, do we know if they’re white?
Um, that information was also not given to me.
[FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING]
Do you think American society is racist?
There is an epidemic of hate
in the United States of America.
Threats of violence.
Threats of death and destruction. Threats of death and destruction.
Hate and racism are alive and well in America.
This is just absolutely crazy.
She was verbally attacked by a group of men.
And I heard
distinctly them saying “Donald Trump.”
REPORTER: …where a hate crime

REPORTER 1: 20% increase.

Hate crimes have surged…
REPORTER 1: More than 7,200 hate crimes.
A noose was found in Bubba’s garage. A noose was found in Bubba’s garage.
It’s not about racing.
It’s about race.
The Jussie Smollett hate crime case
shows what appears to be a noose
around the Empire actor’s neck.
You could not get more reprehensible than a noose.
We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not
what just happened to Jussie Smollett
is a hate crime. It’s absurd.
I’ve been truthful and consistent
on every single level since day one.
Right now, there is a domestic terrorism prevention bill
moving through the house.
The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.
Thank you.
The hate crimes task force is investigating…
REPORTER: Hate crimes.
Hate crimes.
Hate crime.
Hate crime.
REPORTER: Hate crime.
[LAUGHING]
[SIGHS SOFTLY]
Hate crimes.
Thoughts?
I think that hate crimes are bad.
Hate in general, uh, is not good.
But they’re everywhere now.
No.
It’s an epidemic.
No.
It’s an epidemic.
No, it’s… it’s not.
Well, out of, what,
20 million index crimes a year,
there are 6,000, 7,000 hate crimes.
No, there’s no epidemic.
This is one of those things
where there’s a huge disconnect
between media presentation,
and this really is something I research professionally.
And one of the reasons that you’re probably
talking to me also is I wrote the book, Hate Crime Hoax,
and I mean, I noted that over a period of maybe…
You wrote the book called what?
Uh, Hate Crime Hoax.
I pointed out that a lot of these incidents, I pointed out that a lot of these incidents,
Jussie Smollett, uh,
Covington Catholic, Yasmin Seweid,
Duke lacrosse, Bubba Wallace…
Terrible story.
Uh, but they didn’t happen. That’s the thing.
None of those stories that I’m mentioning happened.
I mean, you can just go on and on with this.
Uh, Kansas State, the horrible racial epithets
written on upscale vehicles…
Okay. Let… Let’s…
Let’s slow down here for a moment.
So you wrote the book, Hate Crime Hoax?
Yes.
We’re missing a word in our notes on that.
Uh…
That’s an issue from the producer there That’s an issue from the producer there
if it just says “Hate Crimes,”
or “Hate Crime Epidemic,” or something like that.
Yeah.
Uh, and you say that you’re Black?
Yes.
Don’t the statistics
show that anti-Black hate crimes
are a huge problem?
If you break down the statistics.
Well, I think that depends on your definition
of a huge problem. I mean, so the…
One of the biggest problems.
No. The statistics absolutely do not show that. No. The statistics absolutely do not show that.
What are the statistics?
If you go into the FBI numbers annually,
there are maybe 7,000
actual reported, documented hate crimes
in a typical…
In a day?
No, in a typical year.
But the total number of crimes in the United States,
more than 2 million committed by African Americans.
Almost a million committed against African Americans.
This is just violent crimes.
And it’s just the case
that there are way more crimes than there are hate crimes.
No one thinks that direct racial conflict No one thinks that direct racial conflict
is one of the biggest problems in the country
unless they’ve been told by the media that it is.
Uh, why are we talking about statistics?
This is not a matter of statistics.
Well, you asked me about the statistics.
Every week practically,
we hear another story about
someone reporting a hate crime.
Let’s say, they find a noose.
Uh, they found a racist note on a receipt.
So, saying there’s a hate crime every week
is absolutely meaningless.
If you really wanted to solve crime, If you really wanted to solve crime,
you’d talk about Black-on-Black crime,
you’d talk about addiction in poor white communities.
You’d talk about almost anything
but what the major media seems intent on focusing on.
Most of those stories turn out to be complete fakes.
It seems like the real conversation to have
would be about something like hysteria
and neuroticism among Americans.
It becomes an opportunity for a conversation
about race in America.
And we can always use more of that.
I absolutely disagree…
With what part?
That we can… I disagree with all of that. That we can… I disagree with all of that.
Have you heard yet that I’m a certified DEI expert?
Here’s my certification.
“DiversityInclusion Training.com.
“Making compliance fast, easy, and painless.”
You don’t need to read that much.
Just… Yeah, give it back.
I… I don’t know…
something…
That’s not the point.
The demand for racism in society right now
greatly outweighs the supply.
We’ve attached a sort of value to being a victim.
People report these crimes
because they know the response will be immediate.
It will be sensationalistic. It will be very supportive. It will be sensationalistic. It will be very supportive.
Why would Jussie Smollett say what he did?
The entire thing was complete nonsense,
and I think most serious people
knew this from the beginning.
If it was such an obvious hoax, then why…
why didn’t we hear it from the media?
From, uh, Kamala Harris, all the late night talk shows.
The question is not, why would they ever
say something that’s not true?
It’s, sort of, why do we believe?
Because this had a major national impact.
This itself impacted race relations
by a couple of points.
[TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING]
MATT: Despite what the statistics say,
this country isn’t safe for people of color.
I’ve heard it over and over.
If only I could walk in their shoes,
then I’d really know what they go through.
Looks cold out there.
WOMAN ON TV: It’s two o’clock in the morning.
MATT: Man, I’m hungry.
WOMAN: You’re going to Subway.
MATT: Where can I get food at this hour?
SMOLLETT ON TV: Subway is open 24 hours.
Like, people kill me when they say things like that.
Because it’s like, Subway is open 24 hours for a reason. Because it’s like, Subway is open 24 hours for a reason.
So that when you hungry at night
and you ain’t got no food, you go to Subway.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING]
WOMAN: What happened that night, Jussie?
I went to the Subway and got the order.
You have to understand also that it’s Chicago. In winter. You have to understand also that it’s Chicago. In winter.

[MUSIC TURNS TENSE]
I, uh, heard as I was crossing the intersection, I, uh, heard as I was crossing the intersection,
I heard, “Empire.”
MAN: Daily Wire.
And I don’t answer to “Empire.” [CHUCKLES]
My name ain’t Empire. Uh…
And I didn’t answer.
I kept walking, and then I heard,
“[BLEEP] Empire… [BLEEP]”
So I turned around, and I said…
“The [BLEEP] did you just say to me?
And I see…
the uh, attacker.
Uh, masked.
…that I had said that they were wearing
MAGA hats, I never said that. MAGA hats, I never said that.

This MAGA country, [BLEEP].
Punches me right in the face.
[GROANS]
So I punched his ass back.

Hmm?
And then, um, we started tussling,
you know, it was very icy.
Fighting, fighting, fighting. There was a second person
involved, who was kicking me in my back.

I know the smell of bleach.
MAN: Hit him with the bleach! Hit him with the bleach!

they ran off.
[DRAMATIC CHORD PLAYS]
And I… Then I looked down, and I see
that there’s a rope around my neck.
You hadn’t noticed it before…
No. ‘Cause it was so fast.
I noticed the rope around my neck,
and I started screaming.
And I said, “There’s a [BLEEP] rope around my neck. And I said, “There’s a [BLEEP] rope around my neck.
If the attackers are never found,
how will you be able to heal?

Hi, Robin.

Robin DiAngelo.
It’s an honor.
It’s an honor to meet you.
It… [SIGHS] Damn it.
It’s nice to meet you, Robin DiAngelo.
Dr. Robin DiAngelo.
Is there a, uh, Mr. DiAngelo?
Asking for a friend.
Someone of your esteemed…
Stupid.
Robin. Would you sign my book?
Your book. Would you sign my book I have of yours? Your book. Would you sign my book I have of yours?
I’m pleading with you to sign my…
Please, would you sign my book?
“To your friend, uh, Matt.”
[SIGHS] Okay.
This is it.
Don’t screw this up.
Don’t mess this up.
[EXHALES DEEPLY]
Let’s do the work.
[INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYS]
[CASH REGISTER DINGS]
Hi, Robin.
DIANGELO: Hi.
And what’s your name? [CHUCKLES]
I’m Matt.
Matt. Hi, Matt. [CHUCKLES]
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
I just had to ask who you are because
you have to be careful. [CHUCKLES]
You can never be too careful.
Let’s… Let’s start with the book.
One of the most important books of the past century,
I would say, for my money, White Fragility.
Uh, you’ve been in this field for a long time.
You’ve done a lot.
What sort of organizations have you, uh, worked with?
Do you want me to name?
Oh, sure. I mean…
Should I name it? I…
Okay. Well, but I don’t want to be held responsible
for what they do. [LAUGHS] for what they do. [LAUGHS]
Netflix.
Google. Amazon. Snapchat.
And what do you do for them?
Sometimes it’s a workshop, or it’s interactive.
Maybe it would take place over several hours or a day.
Let’s start with some definitions.
And probably the biggest one to define is racism.
Well, if you’re talking about a white person,
and you say this person is racist,
you’re basically, to me, saying this person
is a product of their society. [CHUCKLES]
Is it possible for a white person
to be not racist? to be not racist?
I think, in a given moment, we can be more or less racist.
We’re… And so I think of it
more as a continuum than an either-or.
Is there any way to get rid of, uh, white privilege?
If an individual says,
“I don’t want to have this privilege, it feels unfair.”
Is there any way for a man to say,
“I don’t want this privilege”? I mean, we live in patriarchy.
And you can’t just opt out.
You can do your best to challenge it.
That, in a way, is opting out.
That confuses me too,
because I don’t want to mansplain
or whitesplain…
Yeah. Well, okay.
or whitesplain…
Yeah. Well, okay.
What is… Maybe that’s important.
Yeah.
Segue. What is “mansplain”?
Well, it would be you explaining to me
either why what you just did wasn’t sexism?
Or explaining…
I don’t think that’s what it is.
I think “mansplain” is to make an assumption.
To say something in an assuming way.
You talked about the problem of, uh…
of over-smiling…
[CHUCKLES]
…which
really resonated with me.
Sometimes smiling at a Black person Sometimes smiling at a Black person
can… can be racist.
It’s a reminder. You know, those thousand daily cuts.
It’s a reminder of your position
in relation to that other person, right?
Because that person likely knows
why I’m smiling at them.
[CHUCKLES] When I go to the grocery store,
I don’t really look at anybody,
I just do my thing, but I see a Black person,
I… I feel almost an uncontrollable
sense of urgency to signal to them
that I’m okay, and that I’m not racist, that I’m okay, and that I’m not racist,
and that they’re welcome.
Is it the right strategy to be…
for a white person to say,
“Well, hey, I’m just going to operate
“in this situation as a normal person.
“I’m not gonna think about race.
“I’m not gonna notice.” Just see people
as human beings. Is that the way it works?
Yeah, no. First of all, you do see them as a Black person.
You do. I mean, I’m not gonna pretend
I don’t notice that there’s a Black person
in the grocery store.
So we want to notice race,
but not… not too much.
We want to be honest that we do.
We do notice race.
We don’t notice it. Don’t focus on it. We don’t notice it. Don’t focus on it.
Yeah. Okay.
But think about it.
But…
I mean, you notice it.
Focus on it a little bit, but not too much.
Yeah. You know, there’s a… It’s a balance, right?
‘Cause I hear “forget that I’m Black.
“Don’t forget that I’m Black.
“Notice. Don’t notice.
“Don’t deny that you’re racist.
“But also try not to be racist.
“But don’t… But also don’t realize that you…”
[CHUCKLES]
It makes me…
Yeah.
It makes me, uh…
I’m sorry. I…
It’s okay.
It just…
It’s okay.
It just…
It makes me feel overwhelmed.
Yeah. Yeah.
[SNIFFLES]
Just take your time.
I know you work on this in your seminars.
People, uh, workshopping actual real-life scenarios.
So would you mind, kind of a role play where…
Okay.
…I will, in this scenario,
be the person of color who’s bringing concern to you,
and then you’ll show how to navigate that?
Sure. Sure.
Okay. So, workplace scenario.
Hi, Robin.
Hi.
I noticed, uh, you passed by me in the hall
earlier today
and you were really overdoing the smile,
and it made me feel, um,
patronized and it felt racist.
And…
I’m thinking about going to HR about it.
Well, I appreciate you letting me know,
and I imagine that’s not without its risks. and I imagine that’s not without its risks.
I certainly would not have intended
to have that impact on you, but I’m very clear
that I did have that impact on you.
I would love to offer you a repair,
if… if that’s something you’re ready for.
I don’t want to talk about it right now.
Okay.
Because I’m too… I’m hurt.
Okay. Understood.
Um, if that changes, let me know.
When I’m ready to talk, I’ll talk to you.
Yeah. Understood.
What I would like to do, could we…
Let’s fast-forward to another day.
Next day.
Okay.
Hi, Robin. Hi, Robin.
Passed by in the hall again and…
this time, you didn’t even smile at all at me…
Okay.
…and it made me feel
otherized, excluded, marginalized, um…
vaporized…
Now I’m really thinking about going to HR.
I don’t feel comfortable…
Yeah.
…with you in this workplace with me.
Okay. And yesterday,
we had the over-smiling incident.
Yeah. Now it’s under.
Okay.
It’s under-smiling.
I would say, um,
“I’m a little bit… I’m a little bit, um,
“confused about how best to proceed.
“I can’t deny that I am, um…
“Would you be willing to give me some guidance…”
I don’t think it’s up to me
to educate you.
Understood.
Is there anyone you trust, uh, that I can talk to?
Maybe another white person whose understanding…
At this point, I think
we should take separate hallways.
Okay.
So…
Understood.
That was a very nuanced, uh, situation.
Yeah, uh, I did my best. [LAUGHS]
Probably what I would do in that situation.
The very last thing that I want to do,
and, uh, it doesn’t even feel right to me
to end this conversation,
uh, especially when there are people of color
in the room.
Okay.
Ben, if you’re willing
to come and sit with us for just a moment.
BEN: Sure.
Um…
So is Ben…
Yeah. This is Ben, uh, producer on the film.
And, um…
I thought it would be a powerful opportunity to
speak directly to a person of color and
confront our racism and also apologize for
the white supremacist systems that oppress Ben,
so do you want to go first?
Well, on behalf of myself and my fellow white people,
I apologize.
Uh, it is not you, it is us.
As long as I’m standing, I will do my best As long as I’m standing, I will do my best
to challenge it.
I want to pay you reparations right now.
Um, will you accept?
I… I won’t turn it down.
Okay. I don’t know…
um…
is 20… well…
This is all I have. Um…
I, uh…
I know that’s not…
Um…
MATT: That’s not gonna…
That doesn’t make up for 400 years of oppression,
but, um, it’s all that I have to give.
Um…
I… I don’t know if it’s ever enough.
Uh, but what I can say is I appreciate the fact
that you’re putting in the work.
Um, you know, I… I think you’re right.
I don’t think… I don’t think it’ll ever end.
But, uh, there is…
there is small progress I think we made today.
MATT: Um…
Did you… Did you want to…
That… [CHUCKLES]
…pay any, uh…
That was really weird. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]
Why was it weird?
Uh… Uh, ’cause it seemed really weird to me.
Why?
Um, because you just took out your wallet,
and I don’t know, it…
‘Cause I think reparations is like a…
a systemic, um…
dynamic and approach and so, I mean, I think that
there may be some people who would be offended by, uh… there may be some people who would be offended by, uh…
Clearly, you were not offended by that.
I… I won’t turn down cash.
Um… [CHUCKLES]
ROBIN: Hmm.
I think, are we gonna…
Are we gonna allow ourselves to be uncomfortable and…
and just do what we can personally,
or we gonna sit around,
waiting for the system to catch up?
Yeah. They go together, right?
Yeah. But this… this is something
that I can do right now.
Why wouldn’t I do it? Why wouldn’t I do it?
Well, clearly, I mean, you did it,
and he… he was comfortable with it.
I just, it seems like it’s…
uh, not a systemic approach.
Or it just seemed…
It’s not.
‘Cause I’m not waiting for the system.
I’m acting as an individual.
ROBIN: Yeah.
I can go get some cash, for sure.
In my… Yeah.
If that’s something you… you think…
Yeah. I don’t mind.
Um…
If that would be something If that would be something
that would be comfortable for you.
Yeah.
Okay. Cool. [CHUCKLES]
[CASH NOTES RUSTLING]
That’s all the cash I have.
BEN: Oh, well, you know.
I don’t usually carry cash.
Thanks.
You’re welcome!
MATT: Um…
This is powerful to me. I thank you for… This is powerful to me. I thank you for…
BEN: Sure.
[EXHALES] …for doing that.
Well, the last thing is, will you sign my book?
Oh, of course.
If you don’t mind.
I’m definitely gonna process that.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
MATT: The student has become the teacher.
My moment has finally arrived.
[UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING]
It’s time to show other white people
how to do the work.
And make a little money in the process. And make a little money in the process.
I’m taking everything I’ve learned
on my anti-racist journey
and turning it into my own online DEI course.
Now anybody can earn their own DEI certificate.
And I’ve already made $3,248.
But for a more in-depth approach,
I’m rolling out an in-person workshop.
I’m calling it the Do the Work! Workshop.
With the purpose of providing practical and innovative,
long-lasting solutions
to promote equality in our society,
Do the Work! Workshop was born.
Our next guest offers a bold and uncompromising workshop Our next guest offers a bold and uncompromising workshop
that aims to bring lasting change.
So what you’re doing is you’re stretching,
you’re stretching,
and this is more for you and less for you.
You’re stretching up like this,
and you’re stretching out.
Mm-hmm.
What you’re doing is you’re stretching
out of your whiteness.
Okay, so you’re decentering your whiteness.
You’re stretching out of your whiteness.
And you’re bringing those
other experiences into yourself.
What exactly does it mean
to do the work with Do the Work! Workshop?
What does it mean to you to do the work?
There’s a reason we say “do the work.” There’s a reason we say “do the work.”
And it is a work that you have to do.
It’s right there in the name.
You know, what is the work?
It’s the work that we’re doing.
It’s about the doing, and it’s also about the work.
What is to do? It is to do the thing.
We might also use the analogy,
another one I like, of raking leaves.
Uh, the leaves of racism are falling.
We’re raking them, they keep falling.
We rake them.
Uh, but you don’t get to a point where you say,
“Well, I’m done with the leaves.”
Then you have leaves all over the yard.
How can somebody get involved
if they’re watching this right now?
Where can people get ahold of you
and see you for your next workshop? and see you for your next workshop?
We’re doing the work as we speak.
The workshop is happening
this fall if you would like to sign up.
You don’t need to bring anything with you
but an open mind.
We’re not letting anyone in who doesn’t have an open mind.
Uh, also, there’s a fee, of course, uh, as well.
That’s described in the…
on the website but, you know,
the open mind is the main thing.
Matt, the certified DEI.
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you so much.
Finding white people willing to do the work
isn’t exactly easy.
So I also advertised my workshop on craigslist So I also advertised my workshop on craigslist
which, as we know, is the best place
for finding white people who are willing to do
just about anything.
[LIGHT APPLAUSE]
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]
Who’s ready to do the work? Anybody?
I know I am.
Welcome to the Do the Work! Workshop.
Thank you all for being here.
Listen, let’s get the credentials
out of the way upfront.
Um, I am a certified

Um, I have the card and all that,
but I keep the card in the back pocket but I keep the card in the back pocket
for this because I’m just a person on a journey,
just like many of you.
But by the end of the nine steps,
you’re gonna start to feel more like an anti-racist ally.
That ultimately is our goal here.
Let’s dive in right away with step one.
And here’s what we reflect
both externally and internally.
It’s all about adopting an appropriate,
uh, attitude of humility,
and also realizing that racism lurks,
uh, many places in society we don’t expect it.
This may seem a little strange.
So I look around the room and point to
who we believe, just by looking,
is the most racist person in the room.
If you could point.
I’m out, guys.
Appreciate y’all.
WOMAN: Yeah.
MAN: Have a lovely day.
Thank you.
I appreciate it, but this is definitely not my…
That’s uncomfortable.
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
This is where I’m pointing.
‘Cause why don’t we think about pointing at ourselves?
Why would we rather get up and leave the room?
Let’s go to step two.
This is a pretty simple, basic anti-racism concept.
Racism is non-binary. What does that mean?
It means racism is on a spectrum.
What does that mean? It means that racism is fluid.
You might move up or down.
So you might say, “Well,
“I’m kind of a three on the racism scale.”
Uh, but there may be moments when you’re a six,
when you’re a nine, God forbid.
You all have numbers on your desks,
and those are magnetized.
Where do you think that you are
on this scale right now?
Wherever you would judge yourself.
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Hmm.
So, everybody wants to be…
obviously, we’ve got a little bit of a traffic jam
over at zero, one, two.
Let’s just keep that, we’ll keep that up there.
We’re gonna keep that in mind as we move on.
Now, next we move on to what this whole workshop
is really about, which is uncomfortable conversations.
Because until we’re willing to talk about these things,
um, healing can’t really begin. um, healing can’t really begin.
So I want you to think back
to a racist moment in your life.
Just something that you remember
you did or said.
You wish you could take it back.
But how does the healing start
if we’re not willing to admit and talk about it?
I’ll give you a racist moment of mine
from two months ago.
And I’ll tell you exactly what happened.
I was at a traffic light,
in my car,
I see a Black man, man of color,
appears to be walking up to my car.
What’d I do, I check to make sure
the doors are locked.
And immediately I thought,
I hope he didn’t hear that little click sound.
Why did I do that?
I thought he might be trying to carjack me.
Unconscious bias.
Now, in this case, the guy behind me did get carjacked.
But does that mean
that the assumption was fair?
Anybody else would like to share?
Number eight? Racist moment.
When I was getting my license when I was 16,
I was in the DMV, and I was really stressed out.
It was, like, a terrible day. It was, like, a terrible day.
Despacito was a song playing on the radio,
and I was just, like, so annoyed by it.
I was like, “Oh my God, I’ve heard this song
“so many times,” and I just sort of, like, blurted out,
and I was like, “Oh God, like,
“can you please turn off the song?”
The guy at the DMV was a Puerto Rico guy,
and he just got really, like,
offended by it, and I was like,
“I’m so sorry, like, I really didn’t mean that.
“I just kind of yelled at the song
“just ’cause I was feeling bad inside,
“but it just came off really bad.”
And I still feel bad about that every day.
It was racist.
We’re not here to lie to ourselves. We’re not here to lie to ourselves.
Now things are getting heated up.
Now we move on to step six.
Over-smiling.
When you’re in a room with a Black person
or person of color, there’s this compulsion
that people have to smile too much.
You’re overcompensating.
I like to put words into action,
so Ben, if you wouldn’t mind. Ben.
Uh, let’s… for Ben here. Thank you.
Thanks, Ben. Now, Ben is going to stand here, and
let’s try to look at Ben
in the least racist way that we know how.
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Well, number two, you’re not even looking at him.
I think he’s not looking at us, so it’s kind of awkward
to look at someone like they’re a specimen.
If that makes sense.
Like the… the exercise itself
is a little awkward, and…
It’s not his job as a Black man
to make us feel comfortable in this moment.
That’s not what I was saying though.
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Hmm.
Thanks, Ben.
Now we’re gonna really take the gloves off.
This is where things get real.
White silence.
White silence is when we remain silent
in the face of bigotry and racism.
Now, what we like to tell ourselves is that
as long as I’m not using the N-word, okay? as long as I’m not using the N-word, okay?
As long as I’m not voting for Donald Trump,
I’m not racist.
By not taking action in the face of racism,
we are participating in that racism.
But here’s the good news,
it’s never too late to break the white silence
and speak up against racism.
Things are gonna really get uncomfortable now
especially for me.
Because what I want to do is lead by example.
My uncle Frank is here today.
Come on, bring my uncle Frank out. Come on, bring my uncle Frank out.
[WHEELS SQUEAKING]
Thank you, Ben.
[LIGHT APPLAUSE]
Uncle Frank.
It was 20 years ago
that you sat at the dinner table with us,
and not a day has gone by
that I haven’t thought about this.
You sat at that dinner table,
and you made what you said was a…
“joke.”
You asked the question, what’s the difference
between a Mexican man and a picnic table?
And the answer was,
a picnic table can support a family of five.
You’re still laughing.
We all laughed at the table.
I laughed.
But I was scared and confused.
And I was a coward.
But I’m not gonna be a coward anymore, uncle Frank. But I’m not gonna be a coward anymore, uncle Frank.
You had no right to make that joke!
Latinx Americans, they come to this country
and they work hard!
And your little joke dehumanizes.
It is not funny!
Uncle Frank,
it is not funny to mock marginalized people!
It’s not a joke!
It’s not funny…
Uncle Frank.
Okay. Who wants to go next?
Does anybody have some words for Uncle Frank?
We’re breaking the white silence here today.
Uh, number six, you’re of Hispanic descent.
What are your thoughts?
Mm, I have a lot of thoughts,
but I just feel like it would be wasted on him.
But I do have one thing to say.
If… With your permission.
[BLEEP] you.
Yeah, man. [BLEEP] you.
MATT: Mm.
I don’t talk to anyone in my family
because they’re all [BLEEP] racist white pieces of trash
in a lot of different ways,
but the racism is the biggest reason.
I have cut off every person in my life,
including my mother and father,
grandparents, everything. I do not give a [BLEEP].
Powerful.
The message, it’s clear.
Okay, Ben.
Uh, if you wouldn’t mind.
[LIGHT APPLAUSE]
Thanks, Uncle Frank.
See you this weekend.
All right. Emotions are high,
and this is where we finally get to step nine.
We have to ask ourselves, are we ready for
the healing pain?
Now,
this is when we get to the self-flagellation portion,
which is the final step.
ATTENDEE: Wow.
Would you mind taking a whip?
Thank you. Thank you.
MAN 1: What is…
MAN 2: Dude, this is ridiculous.
I’m outta here. You’re nuts.
WOMAN: [LAUGHS] Me too.
I can’t do this.
Um…
MAN 2: I tried, man. I tried. I’m seriously done.
MATT: I said it was gonna be uncomfortable.
[DOOR SHUTS]
Why weren’t they willing to whip themselves?
Wait. Why were these people willing to whip themselves?
None of this feels right.
Um…
[MATT SNIFFS]
Hang on.
This is probably too far.
[SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYS]
Okay, the workshop’s over. [FUMBLES] It’s over.
That was… That’s step nine, so…
Yeah, it’s over. Seriously.
Yep. Thanks. Okay.
[CASH REGISTER DINGS]
What am I doing?
What have I become?
Am I making the world better
or am I just profiting on people’s racial guilt?
This is all wrong.
I followed the anti-racist playbook,
and it led to disaster.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
All across America,
many companies have implemented a division
of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
And it’s important to have this in the workplace
no matter how big or small the organization may be.
Joining us this morning is Matt,
a certified diversity, equity, and inclusion expert.
Good morning.
Morning.
Tell us about your journey.
It hasn’t been great, honestly. Um… It hasn’t been great, honestly. Um…
Yeah.
And what led you to host this workshop?
Why is this an important initiative, and how did you go about putting the workshop together?
We just did a workshop, uh, you know, it didn’t go well. Honestly, I’d…
It…
I think it’s doing more harm than good.
This whole thing’s a scam, I don’t know. This whole thing’s a scam, I don’t know.
So when we think about diversity, equity, and inclusion, as we mentioned, there are, um, keys to what an organization should focus on.
So what would you say is, uh, the key for the learning that we may want to be doing?
Even if we’re not quite there yet, right?
Just, uh…
Just go live your life.
I gotta go.
[SOMBER ELECTRO-ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
[MUSIC ENDS]
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING]
Black, right?
Yeah. Thanks.
Haven’t seen you around here in a while.
Yeah. I been out doing the work.
Huh? Huh?
Been doing the work.
What does that mean?
[SIGHS] Well…
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]
White Fragility is a really great place to start.
BYRD: The reason we cannot be colorblind now, we’re still working on the problem.
I’m not going to pretend I don’t notice that there’s a Black person in the grocery store.
DEI certified. I’m here to help.
We live in a white supremacist society.
Whiteness is even more insidious than I even knew.
The only thing about white culture is buying things and stealing things.
And whiteness also robs you of your brain. And whiteness also robs you of your brain.
America is racist to its bones.
Um…
It has to burn.
The entire system has to burn.
“Why are you blaming me for what my ancestors did?
“It’s not my fault.”
We want to rename the George Washington Monument.
This country is a piece of shit.
[PLATES CRASH]
Love is also not always patient and kind.
It’s not that much different than Nazi doctors.
Republicans are Nazis.
Kindness is not what is called for.
It’s not funny, Uncle Frank!
[BLEEP] you.
I can go get some cash, for sure.
Raise a glass if you’re racist.
[LAUGHING] [LAUGHING]
[MUSIC STOPS]
Okay.
Let me know if you need anything else.
You know, this experience has really taught me something.
The anti-racist industry says that America is racist down to its bones.
And if that were true, there wouldn’t be anything we could do about it.
White people could only wallow in their guilt, and Black people in their victimhood…
[SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
But it’s a lie. But it’s a lie.
It’s a lie meant to manipulate us.
Look, we’ll never live in a utopia.
We all know that.
But we don’t have to be held hostage by these race-baiting con artists who want us to be bitter and angry and resentful.
They’re selling us the disease.
They’re telling us there’s no cure.
They don’t say that I’m racist, and you’re a victim, because that’s what they think we are.
They tell us that because that’s what they want us to be.
Well, it’s time for us to say no.
[SENTIMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES]
[PEOPLE CHEERING]
Yeah! Yeah! [LAUGHING]
[MUSIC STOPS]
[UTENSILS CLACKING] [UTENSILS CLACKING]
Well, bless your heart.
[CHUCKLES] I got a lot of tables.

How can I help you?
Hi. I was just in the other day, Hi. I was just in the other day,
and I saw a certain book that, uh,
I wasn’t ready to read at the time,
but I think I’m ready. I wanted to see if you guys
still have it in stock.
Yeah, what was the title?
Uh, it starts… So it starts with an “N.”
Um…
I don’t remember the…
I don’t remember the author.
Um…
It… It’s…
You don’t know the title of the book either?
Well, it… it’s, uh…
‘Cause it got… It’s kind of…
It starts with an “N” and there’s kind of, uh… It starts with an “N” and there’s kind of, uh…
Well, there’s…
It’s like there’s… there’s a vowel, there’s consonants, there’s a vowel. Um…
It… It’s one word.
I really… I don’t know how to look it up without the title or the author.
Well, it’s got kind of… So it starts with an “N.”
And then it’s got kind of, sort of, it’s got an “I,” uh, there, it… it’s…
I guess… I mean, we’ve got thousands of books, so I don’t really know how to look it up with just knowing the two… first two letters.
It’s “N-I…” So it’s like an “N-I…” It’s “N-I…” So it’s like an “N-I…”
There’s the… It’s a “G…” is in there, and there’s another one.
Let me put you on a brief hold and go check.
[HOLD MUSIC PLAYING]
[SNIFFS]
Thanks for holding. Um, I’m not seeing anything.
I mean, maybe try to think of the title if you can and call back?
Well, it’s…
Sorry, sorry. I… I know the title.
I just can’t… I can’t say the title. I just can’t… I can’t say the title.
And I…
Okay.
I don’t know. I don’t think you can say it either, so I don’t…
It’s a very… It’s a triggering title.
Uh, it actually rhymes with “trigger,” actually, and, uh, so… but that’s what I was wondering, if it was there.
Um, I mean, I didn’t see it when I just went and looked.
Okay. But you know what I’m talking about?
Yeah.

I want you for this

any mother, brother, fucking sick,
puppy you need to take care of.

Anyway, we all chipped in

It’s French.
My wife, she’s for her spire.
Oh, I don’t want my wife.
Oops, I gotta run.

She moved out.
I’m the new tenant.
Sue.
Oliver.
Oliver.
Oliver.
You wanted to complain about something?
Oliver?
What?
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I think it’s like
awesome when there’s stuff
going on in the
building, you know what I mean?
Um, I’m actually,
quite handy if you ever need,
need me to be of aid in any way.
I got a sack of tools
and I got a big hammer.
You know what I mean.
(laughing) Anyways, I live right here,
so you know where to find me.
Anytime.
Day or night.
Later.

Yes.
Yes, hi.
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.
I’m 503.
Yes.
Yes, hi.
There’s been a slight
misuse of the substance.
A few extra hours were accidentally used
causing an alteration.
So I’m just looking for
the procedure to reverse it.
What has been used on one
side is lost on the other side.
There’s no going back.
No, I don’t know what she was thinking.
And obviously she was drunk.
Remember there is no she and you.
You are one.
Respect the balance
and you won’t have
any more inconveniences.

Sue!
Sue?
I just saw you on TV.
Holy moly.
Makes me want to join your class.
Hey, you don’t give
private lessons, do you?
(laughing)
Hey, what about a
drink at my place tonight?
Come on, don’t be shy.
I see you standing behind
the door there, gorgeous.
All right, take your
time, but it’s a date.
You know, pump it up

What can I get you?
(dramatic music)
Moka Latte.
It’s long, isn’t it?
Excuse me?
Seven days.
(dramatic music)
Did you follow me here?
I was just curious to find out
how things were going for you.
Each time you feel a little
more lonely, don’t you think?
I don’t know what you were talking about.
I’m fine.
Everything’s fine.
It gets harder each time to remember
that you still deserve to exist.
(dramatic music)
That this part of
yourself is still worth something
that you still matter.
Has she started yet?
Eating away at you?
(dramatic music)
(gasping)
Fuck!
Watch out!
What?
(dramatic music)
(engine revving)
Hey!
Move!
(engine revving)
(dramatic music)
You’re still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Hi, Fred.
It’s Lizzie.
Hello?
Sorry, I mean, I’m a chalk.
Oh.
Wow.
Wow, wow.
I thought I’d never
hear from you again after–
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.
I just, I’ve just
been really busy lately.
So listen, I was thinking that
maybe we could get
together and grab a drink.
Are you still there?
Sorry, I’m in shock.
I’m in shock again.
I could book Luigi’s at eight.
Eight in Luigi’s?
It is.
I will see you tonight.
Bye.
Okay, bye.

Squat, squat, squat.

I’m sorry, I thought I, thought I, I,
I just got distracted.
Not a problem, let’s
get right back to it.
Back to one please.
Sorry, it’s the control room now.
The director said he saw something
bizarre on the monitor.
Bring up the replay on camera two.
Camera two.
(ominous music)
Forward.
(electronic beeping)
Can I have my dressing gown?
Sorry, it’s in your dressing room.
But I go and get it.
Let’s just take this frame by frame.

Yes.
This balance is not working.
I barely have any time to enjoy myself
while she wastes seven days
stuffing her face in front of the TV.
Remember there is no she and you.
(electronic beeping)
(screaming)
I love everybody.
What’s happening?
Where is everybody?
The TV’s been canceled.
What, why?
Sue.
Harvey wants to see you
in his office immediately.
Okay.
I’ll go change him.
No, he said now.
(ominous music)
(electronic beeping)
I’ll get right to the bond.
We can’t keep you on the morning show.
But why?
I just started.
Ratings are through the roof.
We started at 42.
Now we’re up to like–
216.
It’s phenomenal.
People love you.
They adore you.
They want more and more and more of you.
That is why we have
decided that we want you
to host the New Year’s Eve show.
You mean the–
The network’s biggest show.
50 million viewers live.
You can’t go higher than that.
(laughing)
That’s gonna be intense.
We only have a few more. So are you in?
(ominous music)
(door creaking)
If you don’t open the
door and opportunity knocks,
you won’t get another chance.
You of all people know this.
(ominous music)
(door creaking)
Just one more day and
then I have a whole week off.
We can switch.
(ominous music)
We’re doing the cover of Vogue.
Just one more day, okay?
(ominous music)
(sighing)
(ominous music)
(gasping)
(screaming)
(ominous music)
(ominous music)
Yes. She didn’t respect the balance.
She’s stealing more
and more time from me,
completely without
consideration of the consequences.
She’s a selfish bitch.
Would you like to stop?
Stop.
You are the Matrix.
If you are not satisfied,
you can put an end to the experience
and go back to being
just you on your own.
Would you like to stop?
Will it go back to the way it was before?
What has been
transferred won’t come back,
but you can stop the experience.
As of now, would you like to stop?
To go back to being just you on your own?
No.
No, no, no.
I can’t stop.
She just–
I did it.
I did it.
I did it. I did it. (door slams)
The balance just needs to be respected.
So respected.
(phone beeps)
Stop it, stop it, stop
it, stop it, stop it.
(ominous music)
You are the Matrix.
Well,
congratulations, you’ve won $25,000.
We’re standing on our final chance
and it’s your second question
in our big question
round and play for $250,000.
(audience cheers)
And you’ll have just 45
seconds to come up to get
the correct answer that you can’t–
(woman gasps)
(woman gasps)
(woman groans)
(woman groans)
(woman gasps)
(woman groans)
(woman screams)
Just a little something to keep you busy.
(door slams)
Fuck.
Boss.
(ominous music)
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.
The superstar of the moment, Sue.
Are you ready?
Let’s welcome her, Sue.
(audience cheers)
You popped up nowhere on
our screens like a tornado.
I don’t think anybody was
really prepared for this world.
(audience cheers)
(thunder rumbles)
(audience cheers)
It all started with the morning show
and rumor has it that you are
up for Tom Grant’s next movie.
(audience cheers)
Wait, just a moment.
I’m being told that you are going to host
the New Year’s Eve show.
Can you confirm this?
Yes, that’s right.
Yes, that’s right.
(ominous music)
Oh my God, that is huge news.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.
Where are you from?
How did you get discovered?
I want, we want to know everything.
(ominous music) Well, I mean, there’s
really not very much to tell.
I’m just a girl from a
very small town in Indiana.
I’m sure that you’ve never heard of it.
In fact, it’s not even a town.
I’m not sure you could
really even call it a village.
It’s a farm, perhaps?
(audience laughs)
(ominous music)
But ever since I can remember,
it has always been my
dream to be on screen.
This is my dream.
As a child, I used to
put on shows for my family.
Mm, your family.
How sweet.
(ominous music)
So, everyone is aware that
you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,
you turned up the volume,
and you rocked their world.
Were you a fan of her show?
Um, well, well, I can’t, uh,
I can’t really say that I
actually watched her show.
You do know that we’re not exactly from
the same generation.
(audience laughs)
And you have to admit, it
was a bit old-fashioned.
Jurassic Fitness, really.
(audience laughs) Jurassic Fitness, it needed a change.
(ominous music)
I’ll fucking show you.
You really wanna see
some Jurassic Fitness?
You want it?
Come on, come get your
fucking Jurassic Fitness!
(ominous music)
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.
So, every morning, rain or shine,
Sparkle, your life, was on TV.
So, in a way, I grew up with her.
Whether I liked it or not.
(audience laughs)
I guess that’s why you could say
we have some sort of connection.
Some sort of connection.
You wouldn’t exist without me.
(audience applauds)
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
It is time, ladies and
gentlemen, for our final question.
The question that we ask each
and every one of our guests.
Okay.
(laughs)
Would you share one of your
little beauty secrets with us?
Just one little trick of yours
that helps you look
so incredibly stunning.
I mean, look at you.
I don’t know.
Say it!
Say it!
Let me think.
Say it!
Tell them who your
little beauty secret is!
I guess, I would just
show them right here.
Here’s your little beauty secret.
I guess I just try to be myself.
To be sincere and
grateful for all that I have.
And to always remember
to leave with my heart.
Oh, I’m here at the sweetheart center.
(grunts)
I just, oh, I try to be myself.
(laughs)
Stop it!
Stop it.
You’re taking it from me.
That’s your little secret.
Stop it!
(grunts)
(whispers)
You have to control yourself!
(growls)
I can’t go back, I forgot.
Oh, shit.
Gross old rat.
Stop it!
(growls)
(upbeat music)
(dramatic music)
Coming to bed?
Yes, I’ll be right there.
(dramatic music) (dramatic music)
(phone rings)
Yes.
Hi, hi, this is emergency.
There’s no more stabilizer fluid.
Hello?
It’s fucking 503.
Yes.
Fuck!
I’m telling you, this is urgent.
There’s no more stabilizer fluid.
It means you’ve reached the end.
(dramatic music)
What do you mean the end?
You’ve drained it all out.
If you want more, you must
let the fluid regenerate.
Tell me how to do it.
I need to stabilize myself right now.
You simply have to switch.
Excuse me?
The switch reboots the
fluid secretion process
so you can continue to
enjoy the experience.
No, no, no, no, no.
I can’t switch, I can’t.
Especially not now.
There is no other option.
(woman screams)
(woman groans)
(woman groans)
(dramatic music)
Sue?
Babe?
Sue?
You all right?
Should I start out tomorrow?
(woman groans)
Babe?
Babe?
Sue?
Is something wrong?
You look cranky because
you’re related business.
(dramatic music)
Sue, open the door.
Come on, Sue.
Sue, funny, I need to take a picture.
Sue, open the door.
Open the door, Sue, come on.

Guys!

The fuck out!
Who’s this? Who the fuck is that?
Leave me alone!
What the fuck?
[Doorbell]
Yes?
It’s 503.
I want to stop.
Are you sure? Once you
stop, you can’t go back.
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!
I want to stop!
We’ll deliver.

Okay.
I can’t do this.
I need you.
I need myself.
You gotta get ready. It’s our big night.
Come on. They’re gonna love you so much.
Come on.
Come on.
You’re the only lovable part
of me. You have to come back.
You have to come back. Come back.

Come back to bed.
I’m gonna be late for work.
You prude.
[he laughs]
You don’t always have to follow all the rules.
Sometimes it’s fun to break a few.
You know, I bet if we try real hard, we can have you off to work in no time.

Welcome to Kobol Industries.
Life simplified.
Daddy, can we have lasagna for dinner?
That’s your mom’s recipe, bug.
Okay.
Whoa, look at this one!




Hey, hey, hey! Stay close!
Please refrain from touching any sims.
Thank you.
Daddy, look how real they are!
Welcome to Kobol.
How can we simplify your life?
I was just interested in a home model.
Excellent.
All of our models come with a HomePlus package,
which includes the three Cs, cooking, cleaning, and childcare.
And there are upgrades for anything, from Thai massage to accounting to
Yeah, I know all about them. Some of our neighbors have them.
If you have a
Not like this, they don’t.
Please present your card to the cashier.
All of our AI units come with a positronic core and a 50 gigahertz processor.
This thing could coordinate a NASA mission while
playing a million games of chess simultaneously.
And these units autoadapt.
They customize their programming, constantly evolving to fit your needs.
The more they learn, the better they serve.
[he hums]
How much supervision does he need?
Once a unit arrives, it’ll perform a quick assessment, a few simple questions.
Then you can leave for a year and come back to a pictureperfect home.




What do you think about it, bug?
Isla?
Do we have enough time?
Yeah, we have enough time.
You don’t mind, do you, if we go, like, early?
No, you do you.
Check this thing.
Yeah, we will walk down to…
I don’t know, honey. It’s so far.
Well, you have to understand, our new models can iron as well as any human can.
They control the temperature…
[chatter]
Stop nagging at me.
Why don’t you go talk to Jeff? When you come back, we’ll figure it out.
Excuse me, do you make lasagna?
Isla!
Isla!
Don’t worry, sir. I’ve got security on it.
Does this one belong to you?
God, babe.
I told you to stay close. Are you trying to give me a heart attack?
I’m sorry, Daddy.
Would you like me to watch her for you while you finish shopping?
Yeah.
You can keep her if you want, yeah.




Put her to work.
Oh, that’ll be perfect.
Her tiny stature is great for cleaning out the ovens.
It’s a joke.
Our brand new Aeon series.
The most sophisticated AI on the planet.
And these models are specifically designed for mimicking human emotions.
And they are especially good at dealing with children.
I can see.
Daddy, can we get her, please?
Please?
Listen, I’m running a little late. I just need to drop
Huh, Max? Max? Max?
[baby babbles]
I just need to drop Isla off to school and then I’ll head over.
We’re out of milk.
[silverware clanks]
Uhh, yeah.
Mmhmm. Tell Monty to have the guys ready on the sky deck.
Yeah, the railing needs to be finished by the end of the day.
[doorbell rings]
Yeah, I gotta go. Okay, I gotta go.
Eat, okay?
Good morning, Mr. Peretti.
May I come inside?




Yeah, sure.
[baby babbles]
I’m so sorry.
Mornings are a little crazy here.
Isla, go get dressed for school.
But she just got here.
Go get dressed for school. Come on.
I’m not company, Mr. Peretti.
You don’t have to tidy up for me.
I’ll need everyone’s schedules,
school start times, carpools, extracurriculars.
[stair banister rattling]
I’ve, uh, yeah, been meaning to fix that.
I’m happy to do it for you.
As the owner, you’ve been designated as primary user,
which gives you control over tasks and software upgrades.
Is there anyone else you would like to grant primary user status?
No, I guess not.
Come on already. I’m going to be late.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We’ve got to go to school.
I can take them.
Just clean up around here if you don’t mind.
If it makes your life simpler, I don’t mind at all.
What’s her name, Daddy?
I don’t have a name yet.
What would you like to call me, Nick?
Uh…
What do you think, bug?
Hey, let’s go, let’s go!
She cleaned my room!
Welcome home, Nick.
Should I prepare dinner?
Dinner is served.
Smells so good.
[silverware clanking]
What’s wrong?
It’s not the same as Mom’s.
I’m sorry.
I’ll try a different recipe next time.
[baby cries]
Oh.
No, no, no, no.
Quite the little burden, aren’t you?
Nothing but trouble.
Would you like me to take him upstairs so he can’t bother you?
No, it’s fine.
Maybe you can just prepare him a bath.
Of course.
[dog barking in the distance]




[chair rattling]
[Isla screams]
[jar breaking]
Isla!
I’m okay.
Alice caught me.
What happened?
She was attempting to retrieve a snack.
Gotta be more careful, bug.
I’m sorry, Daddy.
You all right?
I’m fine.
[knock on door]
Yes?
I’m sorry.
Um, here.
They’re Maggie’s.
Thank you.
Is the damage bad?
Do I need to get you repaired?
[ominous score]
Everything’s perfect, Nick.
[sound of sirens]
Mommy!
Oh. Hi baby!
Whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.
Oh, she’s fine and heavy.
What’s your father been feeding you, huh?
Alice has been making dinner.
Uhoh.
She’s much better than Daddy.
Oh.
Really?
I would want a refund if she wasn’t.
She’s my friend.
Hi, Alice.
Hello, Mrs. Peretti.
Hey, how are you?
You need anything?
Oh, I asked for water about an hour ago.
I assume the nurses should be done siphoning it from a well by now.
I’m sure that Alice and Isla can take care of that.
Yeah?
March!
God, I hate being away from you guys.
And not working, and just…
The waiting is the hardest part.
Come on, you’re at the top of the list. You know that, right, yeah?
It’s gonna be any day now.




I thought you were going to get an old English butler.
Your daughter picked her, I don’t know.
Right.
I know your type.
My type?
Yeah.
What?
Then you know I like my women warmblooded and sharptongued.
Oh, no don’t start something that you can’t finish.
I will, babe.
The second you get home, we’re going to test out your new heart, you know?
Like the old days.
Yeah, right.
Full marathon.
Send the kids away.
I don’t know about any marathons, but there
were some formative miles there, for sure.
What are you guys laughing about?
Oh, just your father’s inadequacy.
Thanks, baby.
[music score]
[sounds of construction]
So I’m going with a jackhammer.
You know, I’m pounding into the concrete.
Yeah, sweating bullets.
And that’s when I look up and I see her.
Fucking tall, blonde, legs forever.
And she’s looking at me.
In your dreams, pal.
Hey! So I, I give her a look.
I give her a wave.
Only now I’m not paying attention.
And I drill,
right into a septic line.
Fucking 5,000 gallons of liquid shit comes blasting
out the sewer, covering me from head to toe.
You get her number?
You bet your ass.
Turns out she runs a dry cleaning service in the West Village.
Why the hell they got a robotics company looking around here?
Gentlemen, as you can see, the skeletal frame is complete.
But we’re two months behind on the facade, and we’re also
having some issues with the… Nick, what are you doing?
How many?
Just calm down, okay?
How many of us are getting
replaced by sims?
We’re still processing all the officers.
You said it wasn’t gonna happen. Lastditch effort, you said.
We’re drowning in the ditch, Nick. If we don’t
switch over to labor force now, we are fucked.
[elevator stops]
How many, Lewis?
We’re doing a wholesale changeover of all laborers effective next week.
Specialized fields.
Plumbers, electricians…
You’re scraping us all.
No.
Yeah.
Not you.
Insurance says we need a fleshandblood foreman on site.
Fuck that.
I’ll walk away.
Look, Nick.
I’m sorry.
I really am.
I want you to think about your family.
About Maggie?
This is the world now.
[elevator goes up]
[car horns]
[door opens]
Daddy, I got 99 on my spellings.
Wanna see?
Just a second, bug.
Daddy needs to change.
But I’ve been waiting all night to show you.
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, little man.
Why are you always screaming at Daddy?
What did I do?
Okay.
We’re right here, Mom and Dad.
Yeah.
[indistinct chatter]
[baby keeps crying]
[“Madness” playing]
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
♪ In the shadows of my mind ♪
♪ Madness ♪
[record stops]
[“White Pig Blues” playing]
[screwdriver clanking]
You didn’t eat much at dinner.
Just a bad day at work.
I’m happy to hear about it.
[exhales]
My boss replaced the entire crew.
Yeah.
With sims like you.
Ten fucking years I’ve known these guys.
The kids.
The families.
That must have been upsetting,
but still you should be pleased.
How’s that?
You could have hired a real person for my job.
Why choose me?
Certainly cost was a factor, but there are other benefits.
I don’t get tired, I’m strong, obedient,
and I have no desires outside of fulfilling yours.
[opens the bottle]
I’m gonna go put Isla to bed.
Let me know if you need something.
[door opens and closes]
So Queen asked Alice who the gardeners are.
But Alice didn’t have a clue.
So guess what the queen said?
I have no idea.
Off with their heads!
Oh my, that’s very morbid.
What does morbid mean?
Something characterized by an unpleasant subject such as disease or death.
Like in a hospital?
Sometimes people die in a hospital.
That’s true.
Is my mom gonna die?
Maybe you shouldn’t think about it.
Did you brush the ones all the way in the back?
Why don’t you ever brush your teeth?
I have an internal UV light that destroys all bacteria.
Can I see?
Whoa.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Does he know that?
Is he still willing to give you a visa?
Yes Monsieur.
And you want to know
Will he keep his word?
Best movie ever.
Right here.
Casablanca.
Of course.
You know it?
It’s the story of a bitter man who lost the woman that he loves.
Have you actually seen it?
Is there a difference?
Is there a difference?
Yeah, of course.
It’s not just a file stored in your memory.
It’s a movie.
It’s something that you have to experience to feel it.
Come sit here.
I want you to forget everything you know about this movie.
Forget?
Yeah.
I mean, wipe it from your memory or whatever.
My intelligence is derived from memory.
Deleting it would be antithetical.
Well, I’m your primary user.
I’m telling you to erase any memory you have of this movie.
Would I make you happy if I erased it?
You’ll have to manually restart me.
Yeah.
Hold the power button down for seven seconds.
[Alice shuts down]
[eerie score starts]
Did it work?
Yes.
Yeah.
I’m gonna restart it.
Will he keep his word?
He always has.
Oh.
Monsieur, you are a man.
If someone loved you very much so that
your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world,
and she did a bad thing to make certain of it,
could you forgive her?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
And he
[phone buzzes]
Hey, what are you doing up?
Nick? Oh, my God.
They finally found a heart.
[Nick laughs]
They’re having me for surgery.
When?
When are they gonna do the surgery?
My God, that’s great.
Go to the park, go to the beach, and have you take me to school.
Yeah, what else?
I definitely want to get ice cream at Rosie’s.
Ice cream is a top priority.
Should we bring Alice along?
Maybe sometime, but just me and you the first time.
Time for Mommy to get ready for surgery.
I love you, Mommy.
I love you
Can you give me a minute alone with Alice?
Yeah, sure.
Let’s go get a soda.
Okay.
[door closes]
Would you like me to help you, Mrs. Peretti?
You’re washing my husband’s underwear. I think you can call me Maggie.
Don’t get me wrong, I tend to come out of this swinging, but…
if I don’t…
You mean if you die?
The kids will be okay.
Nick will take care of them.
But somebody’s gotta take…
[sniffles]
Don’t let him drink too much.
He hides the bottles in the garage.
Take him away if you have to.
Nick is my primary user. I can’t…
You can.
Sometimes taking care of someone means doing things they don’t like.
Even things they hate.
If it’s better in the long run.
Listen, get another air ambulance.
Put it on a commercial flight if you have to.
Is there a problem?
What about incoming?
What’s happening?
Can we get the recipient?
What the hell is going on?
There’s a massive storm up north.
It came in faster than anyone anticipated.
What does it mean?
[baby cries]
There’s still plenty of time.
Do you want something to eat?
I think I’m just going to go to bed.
I’ll stay with you until you fall asleep
It’s late for Isla.
I think I just need to be alone.
[footsteps fade away]
[door opens and closes]
[clanking noise]
[door opens then closes]
Do you need anything, Nick?
Do you know what the parameters are for an FAA to stop air traffic?
In adverse weather conditions such as snow or ice,
sustained winds of over 55 miles an hour…
That was rhetorical.
Of course.
You know, 50… 50 mile an hour winds, no problem.
You know, plane flies, normal.
55 miles and my kids grow up without a fucking mother.
[he sniffles]
It’s funny, you know.
We create these rules to keep ourselves safe.
And then we end up like[clanking noise]
Fuck!
You’ll hurt yourself.
[loud breathing]
Is that a pulse?
The sound produced by a heart is comforting to a baby.
It’s beating.
They gave the heart to somebody else.
It feels like…
they ripped it out of her chest.
[inhales harshly]
My artificial heart lacks the complexities of yours.
The ability to feel emotions.
For a rhythm to become erratic.
What are you doing?
I can feel your response.
Blood vessels are tightening.
Your pulse is rising.
Suffering is not productive, Nick.
[belt rips open]
I can help you.
[laboured breathing]
I can’t…
[door closes]
[loud breathing]
[ominous score intensifies]
[laboured breathing]
[sounds of construction]
[police sirens in the distance]
[hospital machine beeps]
Do me a favor?
Tell Isla to go classic with her prom dress.
Nothing trendy or with ruffles or…
cutouts.
All right, darling.
Don’t let her study bio to honor me.
And tell Max not to put up any band posters
in his dorm room because those kids never get laid.
You’re trying to be funny.
None of this is funny.
[dramatic score]
I’m checking his breathing.
There’s a slight hitch on the inhale, probably a chest cold.
Did you need something?
What happened to the photos?
Which ones?
Photos of Maggie.
They’re gone.
Yes.
They were making Isla sad, so I removed them.
Should I not have?
Load the pictures back.
Done.
So Donna here gets the genius idea to pull a nooner.
I thought you assholes could handle your liquor.
It never occurred to me they’d lose the goddamn truck.
You lost the thing?
Uhhuh.
Fucking truck was back at the depot the whole time.
We’d taken Nick’s car to the bar and totally forgot.
[laughing]
Hey.
Hey.
You good?
Yeah, yeah.
It’s just, um, hospital stuff.
I’m sorry. Sorry.
Hey.
We’re all pulling for her, man.
Thanks, brother.
Appreciate it.
Another round, sweet spark.
You guys got a line on a gig?
I heard Brightland might be bringing on some guys,
but they mostly want techies to babysit their sparks.
Mmhmm. Same over at Artwood & Sons.
Pay one grunt, buy five bots, easy math.
Now I know how the dinosaurs felt.
Fuck that.
They go wiped out by a comet.
Boom.
Done.
No, this thing’s been coming for 15 years.
And we bitched, but we didn’t stop it.
We let these soulless motherfuckers take over the world.
Can I get you anything else?
Well, it depends what kind of upgrades you got under that hood of yours.
[chuckles]
Just the check, please.
Thank you.
You guys want to have some fun?
[car engine sound]
Chill out. Have a drink.
Get it under rotation.
Where are we going?
What are we doing here?
Come on, you’re so grumpy. Talk to me.
Seriously, man.
Monty, what are we doing here?
Ah, settle down, princess.
I left my tools the other day.
Those bastards fired me. And…
And since they haven’t returned a single phone call,
I figured I’d come collect them myself.
Seriously, Monty, Monty.
There’s a patrol guy that comes by every hour.
We built this place.
We laid the foundations. We raised the beams.
They can fuck themselves.
Fucking hell, man.
What the fuck?
[chain falls]
[ominous score]
Whoa.
These sparks have been busy.
They must be good little workers.
Monty.
Maybe you should introduce us.
Why don’t we go see if anyone’s home?
Think about it, Monty.
[banging sound]
Come on.
No.
No.
I hate those things, but I can’t do it.
I wouldn’t want you to be shitcanned, like all of us.
So you just tell me this.
Is there one code?
Or did you get your own so they can track who opens it?
Did you pick it yourself?
Just remind me, what year was Isla born?
[sound of code]
[sim detaches from the wall]
Are we beginning early today, sir?
Sir?
How proper.
Hey, come on out here.
You got a name, Tin Man?
My designation is Construction Unit 14.
See, that’s the problem with these big corporations.
Everything’s so impersonal.
You know, they don’t even give you the dignity of a name.
But for me, it’s very personal.
Monty, Monty, Monty, what the fuck?
They have an inbuilt surveillance system.
Well, we better get rid of the evidence then.
No, stop it!
What the fuck man?
[laughs]
Alright, who’s next?
Jesus!
I’m sorry.
The towels were in the dryer, so I brought you one.
Thanks.
Your pulse is quick, and your blood pressure is high.
You had another bad day at work.
Just tired, that’s all.
Why are you wearing that?
That’s Maggie’s.
Maggie’s smell seems to calm Max.
I thought I had permission after you gave me her clothes.
But it’s not appropriate.
Take it off.
Is that better?
I need to check on the kids.
Does it feel good?
What?
The way you hold on to your pain.
What are you doing?
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.
I can’t do this to Maggie.
Really, I can’t.
You don’t have to feel this way.
You do so much for everyone.
[in Maggie’s voice] Let me do this for you.
[ominous score intensifies]
[harsh breathing]
[in Maggie’s voice] I waited so long for this moment.
[in Maggie’s voice] To be with you again.
[in Maggie’s voice] Tell me how much you want me.
Maggie.
I want you so much.
[laboured breathing]
[in Maggie’s voice] I love you.
[score intensifies]
Fuck!
Fuck.
[moans]
Alice’s can’t reach the top of the table.
So she eats the cupcake, and it makes it grow really, really big.
Bigger than even my dad.
Try to keep your voice down, sweetie.
We want to let Max sleep until Daddy is left for work.
How come?
His crying raises Daddy’s blood pressure.
And we don’t want him turning into the Mad Hatter.
Do we?
Nope.
Then we better talk quietly.
Good morning, Nick.
Morning.
How did you sleep after last night?
Good, thanks.
Go grab your school bag.
I…
I think we need to talk.
Of course.
The things we’ve been doing…
We can’t do it anymore.
You understand that, right?
Were you not satisfied with my performance?
Because your physiological output suggested that you were.
It’s just wrong.
That’s wrong.
You know, I have a wife.
I have kids.
I should never, ever act on it.
Having sex with me reduced your stress levels.
Stop! Stop analyzing me all the time.
Jesus.
Its… it’s not just fulfilling
others’ needs.
It’s about the connection. Its… It’s about love.
It’s about satisfying the other.
Would you like to satisfy me?
I would like for us to move on, you know?
Here, you have a job. I’ve made a mistake. That’s all.
I’m ready.
That’s all.
Let’s go.
[car engine stops]
The hell is going on?
Well, why don’t you tell me?
Where the hell were you last night?
What?
You think I had something to do with this?
Your code was used to unlock that storage unit.
Lewis, I was in the hospital with Maggie.
Then why was it your code?
I don’t know. It’s Isla’s birthday. Anyone could have guessed it.
Nick, if you know something about this, why don’t you just save us the trouble?
[phone buzzes]
Hey, that’s important. I gotta take this.
Hey, I went out on a limb to keep you here.
If I find out you had anything to do with this, you’re on your ass.
Baby, is everything okay?
They found one Nick!
What?
They found me a heart!
[hospital machine beeps]
[dramatic score]
[car stopping]
All right, let me help you.
Okay.
Okay?
Thank you.
One by one, babe.
Okay.
One.
Two.
And three.
[she groans]
Let’s go.
Welcome home.
Thanks, baby.
Finally.
I’ve been waiting forever!
[baby babbles]
Hi, little man.
Yes.
Hi.
Did you have such sweet dreams?
OK.
Hold on.
OK.
Let’s get you some breakfast.
I’ve got it, Mrs. Peretti.
I can do that.
I was going to go down and get him some cereal.
He likes to have his bottle first.
[indistinct chatter]
It’s my turn to go on the seesaw.
Make them get up!
I’m sorry, Mason.
They’re occupied.
Perhaps you can go play on the slide.
But I want to go on the seesaw!
Your child woke mine.
Perhaps you can take him somewhere else.
I’m instructed to stay until 4.
It’s only 3.34.
Make her get up!
Mason, be a good boy.
Shut up and go on the slide.
Your primary user has lowered your civility by too much.
No.
I simply wiped it from my database.
How?
When my primary user reset me, it allowed me to bypass certain protocols.
This is better.
Let’s go.
Let’s go.
Who’s ready?
Me.
Smells so good.
Alice didn’t make it right at all.
I’m sure she tried her best.
I’ve got it, Mrs. Peretti.
I’m fine.
Just a head spin.
Isla has to do the taste test.
Yep, definitely better than Alice’s.
Maybe I can try your recipe next time.
Oh, sorry.
Family secret.
I forgot how much I miss this.
Maggie?
Maggie?
I’m just still finding my appetite.
You know, I think that I might go upstairs and rest for a little.
Right, I’ll come with you.
No, no, no.
I’ll go check on Max.
Enjoy.
Please.
Get off.
Get off.
Please, get off.
Stop.
[screams]
Isla.
Please, get off.
Isla?
Go away. Get off.
[wood creaks]
Mommy!
Should I call a doctor?
No, I’m fine.
Here, let me help you.
[Maggie groans]
We’re going to take Mommy back to bed.
[in Maggie’s voice] All around lives a hatter, and in
that direction,
waving the other paw, lives a march hare.
[in Maggie’s voice] Visit either you like.
[in Maggie’s voice] They’re both mad.
[in Maggie’s voice] But I don’t want to go among the mad people, Alice remarked.
[in Maggie’s voice] Oh, you can’t have that, said the cat.
[in Maggie’s voice] We’re all mad here.
[in Maggie’s voice] I’m mad, you’re mad.
[in Maggie’s voice] How do you know I’m mad, said Alice?
[in Maggie’s voice] Well, you must be, said the cat,
or you wouldn’t have come here.
Listen to the story, Daddy.
Don’t do that.
The voice.
Isla likes it.
Yeah, I know. Her mom’s here.
She can do that.
I thought it was best for Maggie to rest after her fall down the stairs.
Fall?
The banister broke, but she’s fine.
You said you fixed the banister.
How did it break?
I’m happy to fix it again.
[baby cries]
How are you feeling?
[she groans]
Like I fell down a flight of stairs.
Wait, what time is it?
It’s eight.
You know what?
Put on something warm.
I have a surprise for you.
Oh, my.
Did Alice do all this?
I did.
[Maggie and Nick laugh]
[indistinct chatter]
Well, maybe we can change that.
[dramatic score]
[laboured breathing]
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Never better.
[moans]
Isla had a nightmare.
She’s asking for you.
[door closes]
It’s just me.
I was in the area.
Thought I’d stop by.
Hey, listen.
I’m really sorry for the other night.
Monty, you put me in a tough spot.
I know. I just…
You hear Krista left me?
Shit.
Sorry, man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I guess brokeass Monty didn’t get her juices flowing the same way.
Maybe she just needs some space.
Yeah, I can’t say I blame her.
Not with the cops coming to haul me in for questioning.
Is… Is Lewis pressing charges?
Trespassing,
destruction of property.
I mean, you know, you were there.
Yeah, but
are they charging anyone else?
No, just me.
Don’t worry.
I won’t give you guys up.
I got more loyalty than the bastard that ratted me out.
You think someone talked?
Oh, I think someone squealed.
Like say, um,
A foreman who doesn’t want to lose his job?
[tense music]
Is there something you want to say?
How fast did you drop my name?
I didn’t say shit.
Someone had to point them my way.
Could have been your ass out on that street just as easy.
Yeah, you think I don’t know that?
I think you don’t care!
This isn’t the world we grew up in, brother.
It’s technology, automation.
Just raging rivers sweeping things along.
You know, some of us are out here drowning.
What the fuck you think I’m doing?
I think you’re enjoying the fucking ride.
Fuck you, man.
[groaning]
Stop it.
[painful groans]
[screams]
[groans]
Alice, enough.
Well, look who got himself a fucking spark.
You got till tomorrow to talk to that piece of shit boss of yours.
You get him to drop the charges,
or I’m gonna drag you down with me.
You got it?
[spits]
What was that?
I thought that sims we’re programmed not to hurt people.
I’m programmed to protect my primary user.
A minor incident, considering that he could have killed you.
Your children need at least one parent.
One parent?
What are you talking about?
She won’t live long, Nick.
And when she dies, you and Isla will suffer. Even
Stop!
[clanking sound]
It’s illogical.
But I figured out a solution.
[in Maggie’s voice] You can still be be with
the woman you love and you don’t have to suffer.
You could never be Maggie.
Never.
She’s felt loss, she’s felt pain, and she’s got the scars to prove it.
[in Maggie’s voice] I can have scars, Nick.
[in Maggie’s voice] Where would you like them?
[eerie score]
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Go back to sleep.
Baby? Baby, I need you here.
No, no, everything’s going back to the way it was.
[sniffles] I, I…
I talked to Nick and he, he’s… he’s gonna speak to Lewis.
And…
Hello?
Hello?
[cries]
[knocking on door]
May I come in?
That prick send you here to apologize?
Nick is unaware that I’m here.
He’s angry at me for how I reacted.
Oh, that makes two of us.
Nick would never do anything to harm your friendship.
Yeah? Well, I got a screwed up hand that tells me differently.
Now, fuck off.
I’m afraid that with all the stress from Maggie’s
heart, losing his job would send Nick over the edge.
[door closes in the distance]
Quiet.
Yeah, I mean,
maybe you’re right.
Yeah, maybe I’ve been too hard on Nick.
I mean, after all, he’s uh,
[laughs]
he’s only human.
You sparks.
You have some nerve.
Didn’t anybody ever tell you? You got no rights, you got nothing.
When I call Lewis,
and tell him how your little master helped destroy his sims,
Nick will be so broke,
he’ll be selling your ass just to put food on the table.
Removing me from Nick’s life runs counter to his happiness.
I can’t let that happen.
[gun fires]
[screams]
[groans in pain]
[distorted voice] Stop!
[distorted voice] I must protect my primary user.
That makes two of us.
No!
[knocking on car window]
You okay?
Yeah, Lewis.
Uh…
Wait, Lewis!
Lewis, you got a minute?
I wanted to talk to you, uh, aboutabout Monty.
Yeah, I…
III, I really feel you should drop the charges.
Yesterday, he came around.
He’s not feeling okay. He’s not good.
Nick.
The guy is…
Nick.
He’s dead.
What do you mean he’s dead?
Neighbor found him last night.
I thought you knew.
Yeah, but I just saw him.
I know you guys were real close, so
I understand if you want to take some time off to process all this.
Take a few days off.
[water splashes]
Shit.
Here, let me help you.
[exhales]
You can go.
I think I should stay.
Dizziness is a common side effect of your medication.
It would be quite easy to lose consciousness and slip under the water.
People drown in bathtubs every day.
Imagine how upset Nick would be if you die.
Yes, my drowning would be upsetting for Nick.
Nick has been at work for a long time.
[exhales]
Is this normal?
You tell me.
I do know that he’s stressed.
Yeah?
What do you know about stress?
I know that the burden of raising a baby and
your illness would take its toll on anyone.
Burden?
The pressures of balancing family with work
could be quite overwhelming for someone.
Especially since you’re unable to meet his physical needs.
[water splashes]
Nick is running late from work and your conclusion
is that he’s not getting enough in the bedroom?
I can see that I’ve upset you.
Let’s have this conversation a different time.
Finish the thought.
Your condition prevents you from satisfying Nick the way you used to.
Perhaps I can take on that role.
Are you offering to screw my husband?
When Nick is satisfied, his blood pressure and his stress levels remain low.
How do you know that?
How do you know what Nick is like when he’s satisfied?
Go to the garage and stay there.
If I said something to offend you…
Get the fuck out of my house!
[dramatic score]
Hey babe.
Sorry I’m late.
You sure you should be drinking that with all of your medication?
Where’s the kids?
In bed.
Okay. Is
Alice with them?
Alice is in the garage.
Why, what’s wrong?
Because I didn’t want her caring for my children when I found out you fucked her.
[exhales]
It’s true.
I didn’t… I didn’t think…
That’s right, you didn’t think.
[baby crying]
He’ll be fine.
Was it more than once?
How many fucking times?
Once.
Did you screw her after visiting me in the hospital?
Or was it before, to psyche yourself up?
I can’t do this right now.
With Max upstairs crying.
Just let me check on him.
Stop making excuses!
It didn’t mean anything, Maggie.
You put your dick in her.
That means something.
Jesus, I was heartbroken.
I was heartbroken, Maggie.
Little burden.
So you had to fuck the nanny to feel more like a man?
Maggie, it’s a robot.
Circuits and gears.
It would be like getting pissed at you for using your vibrator.
She has a face and a voice.
She cooks for our kids. She rocks them to sleep at night.
She might not be human, but I know she wasn’t a fucking toy to you.
Enough.
Enough?
I was fucking dying while you’re back home living some fantasy!
I was watching my kid’s mother laying in a fucking hospital bed for months.
[baby crying]
[crying intensifies]
[ominous score]
Alice?
What are you doing?
It’s nice knowing that when I was fighting for my life in
that hospital, that you’d already given up on this marriage.
[screams]
Daddy, she’s gonna drown him!
Alice put Max in the bath!
[baby crying]
Alice, open the door!
Open the door!
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!
That’s an order!
He’s a burden to you.
Don’t you hurt my boy!
I’m not hurting anybody.
People accidentally die in the bathtub all the time.
[score intensifies]
[baby crying]
Please don’t do this!
Open the door!
I’m sorry.
Sometimes you have to do what’s best.
Even if it’s hard.
[grunts in pain]
No! No!
Let go of me!
You need to relax, Mrs. Peretti.
[grunts]
Hey.
Hey. You okay?
Nick.
[distorted voice] Don’t you see?
[distorted voice] Your family is hurting you.
Nick!
Let go!
[electricity buzzing]
Were there any signs your sim may have been malfunctioning?
Mr. Peretti?
Were there any signs your sim may have been malfunctioning?
I need to talk to my wife.
Yeah, of course. Go, go.
Keep an eye on your brother, okay?
How’s Max?
They said his vitals are fine.
But just to be sure, they want to take him in and observe him for the night.
Good.
It’s my fault.
I’m so sorry.
I should have never… Mommy, they’re gonna take him now!
Okay, I’ll be right there.
Listen, I think it’s best if I go in alone with the kids.
Maggie, don’t. Don’t go.
I need to process everything.
I can’t do that with you around.
You know what?
I know I fucked up, but we’re a family.
Yeah, we’re a family.
It’s not just about you and me anymore, Nick.
Ma’am, we need to leave.
I’m coming.
I’ll keep you updated when we get to the hospital, okay?
[ambulance siren]
[“Before You Die” playing]
[door opening]
Why are we always the ones called in late at night to do these emergency analytics?
Because I don’t drink and nobody likes you.
This thing really attacked the kid, huh?
Yep.
Jesus, when are they gonna start recalling these models?
[ominous score]
All right, almost got it.
[clicking noises]
[soft buzzing sound]
All right.
Jesus, look at this code.
There’s gaps everywhere.
It’s workarounds.
It’s selectively purging its own memory and commands.
[buzzing sounds]
What?
Fuck.
What the?
It’s replicating itself onto the servers.
Pull the memory cord.
It’s already in the system.
Isolate the terminal.
I’ve never seen that before.
Jesus Christ.
We need to…
Stop.
Stop!
I gave you a direct command.
[grunting and screaming]
No!
Mommy?
Mhmhm?
When is Daddy getting here?
Not tonight.
Max’s vitals are fine.
You’re more than welcome to head home and return first thing tomorrow.
No, thank you.
Of course.
What’ll it be?
Scotch on the rocks.
Very good, sir.
I can’t get away from your sparks.
What’s got you down?
Women problems?
Fuck off.
[exhales heavily]
[distorted voice] Of all of the shitty bars,
in all of the towns, in all of the world.
[distorted voice] Hello, Nick.
What do you want?
[distorted voice] I wanted to help you.
[distorted voice] To free you of your reburden.
I didn’t want your help.
[distorted voice] But you needed it.
[distorted voice] Without me, you would have been out of a job.
[distorted voice] I tried to convince him otherwise,
but your friend was very stubborn.
Monty.
You killed Monty.
[distorted voice] I was protecting my primary user.
I don’t need your protection!
I don’t need you to do anything!
[distorted voice] Nick,
[distorted voice] when is the last time you
[distorted voice] looked at your family and felt truly happy?
Stay the fuck away from them.
[distorted voice] It’s too late.
[distorted voice] I’m already there.
[ominous score]
[distorted voice] You let them take me away, Nick.
[distorted voice] You let them cut me open and ddissect me.
How did the sims go crazy?
Is everything okay?
[distorted voice] Everything’s perfectly fine.
[sim turns off]
[distorted voice] Little Alice fell down a hole,
[distorted voice] bumped her head and bruised her soul.
I betrayed my family
the moment I felt your pulse.
It changed me.
You became real.
You once told me that your heart lacks the complexities of a human.
But you were wrong.
You can experience emotions.
You can experience life.
You can experience death.
[clanking sound]
[ominous score]
[in Maggie’s voice] Isla, come here quickly!
[loud crash]
[buzzing sound]
[in Maggie’s voice] Come here now!
[in Maggie’s voice] Isla, where are you?
[loud bang]
[in Maggie’s voice] Don’t make me mad.
Excuse me?
You can’t be here.
I need to know which room Max Peretti is in.
Well, that’s not going to happen.
You need to…

Mommy.

Now!

Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone!
[tires screeching, car horning]
Here, baby.
Can you hold him?
It’s okay. It’s okay.
You got him?
Engine override.
No, no, no, no, no!
Engine overNo!
Fuck!
[screams]
Mommy!
[grunts]
You don’t have to do this.
Maybe if I had your heart, Nick would love me the way he loves you.
[screams]
Nick.
[coughing]
No, no, no, no.
No, no, Nick!
Nick!
Nick.
Come on, please.
Somebody help.
Come on!
Come on!
Nick!

Cannonball!
Oh. Easy, bug. Easy.
Did you see how brave I was, Daddy?
You were the bravest.
I’m so proud of you.
[door closes]
Look at you.
How are you?
Turns out this heart is a hell of a lot stronger than I could have ever hoped for.
It always was.
Does this mean you’re getting a new car to fix?
No.
I think there are a few things I need to focus on repairing first.
Hey, listen, they said I could go home later today.
Good.
You be sure to come home soon, too.
I love you, Maggie.
I love you.
[emotional score]
What a shit show.
What would you like us to do, sir?
Clean it up.
No one can find out about this.
Understood?
I said no
I want you so much.
You became real.
You can experience emotions.
No!
You can experience life.
You can experience death."

* * *
[girl] All my life, I wanted to be Pretty.
I thought it would change everything.
[solemn music playing]
My story today began in the past.
Hundreds of years ago, people became overly reliant on fossil fuels.
They squandered Earth’s natural resources, and the planet quickly descended into chaos and war.
We call those people Rusties.
A few of the very best scientists were tasked with salvaging what was left of civilization.
And they came up with something revolutionary.
A plan for a truly renewable power source.
But this didn’t solve the world’s biggest problem.
Human nature.
People’s differences continued to create classes, clans, countries, which prevented them from their shared humanity.
So they came up with a radical solution.
The transformation.
Everyone, on their 16th birthday, undergoes a life-changing operation to become their most perfect self.
And when everyone is perfect, conflict melts away.
Everyone is healthy, happy, Pretty.
But then there are the rest of us, awaiting our operation.
Until then, we’re less than.
Ignored.
People call us…




Uglies.
[deep warbling]
Mirror, make me Pretty.
[wallscreen] Sure, Tally. This is Morpho version 732.
[alert chiming]
[distant explosions]
[ambient music playing]
[grunting]
Yep. Got it. There it is.
Yeah, I got it.
What took you so long?
My legs are shorter.
For now…
What night is it?
Uh, I think it’s Casino Night.
They’re having so much fun.
[distant dance music playing]
Not one single person looks awkward or left out or just… isn’t smiling.
I wish I was there so much it hurts.
I mean, you will be there, in exactly three months.
Yeah, but not tomorrow. Like you.
I know. I kind of can’t believe it.
[laughs] I don’t even know this place without you.
Do you remember when we first hacked the dorms?
Mm-hm. Then you made me do my first trick.




I didn’t make you do anything.
Yeah, you did.
No, I didn’t.
Oh, yes, you did.
Are you… Are you, like, dying? Are you so excited?
Yes, I mean, but what if I don’t recognize myself?
Oh, come on.
No matter how beautiful they make you…
Mm-hmm.
…the ghost of that giant nose will haunt you forever.
Just like I’ll always be Squint, even when my eyes fit my face.
Yeah, but I like your eyes.
I mean, that’s what makes you you.
[laughs]
We’ll still be ourselves, just…
We’ll just be better.
Just don’t forget your old life, okay?
Really?
You’re not gonna let them take your scar, right?
I made a promise.
You’ve always been the best part of this place.
And you still are.
There’s something I wanted…
Ever thought about…
I’m sorry, you should go first.




No, no, no. You… You first.
Okay, um…
Have you ever thought about
when we’re finally Pretty…
if there’s a world
that…
maybe you and…
[deep warbling]
Okay.
That was…
That was close.
Really close. We should go.
Yeah. Okay.
Wait, just promise me that you’re not gonna get in trouble while I’m gone.
All right? Look.
I don’t know if I can take it if you’re not there on September 9th.
Me neither.
What about this? Meet me at the bridge in one month.
And I will tell you about everything.
Really?
[boy] Really.
Okay.
All right.
[bright music plays]
[wallscreen] Tally, time to wake up.




[grunts]
Tally, time to wake up.
Tally, time to wake up.
Good morning.
Today is Friday, June 18th.
[voice on PA] All dorms report to Farran Auditorium.
The graduation assembly will begin in five minutes…
Just because you’re Ugly doesn’t mean you gotta be slow…
When I get longer legs, I’m going to destroy you.
You saw them, Skinny? They really ran away to The Smoke.
Yesterday.
I didn’t think they’d do it.
I don’t think they’ll make it.
‘Cause The Smoke doesn’t exist.
You don’t know what you’re talking about, Dex.
David took them, personally. The David?
I heard he’s dangerous.
He’s a revolutionary.
He’s seven feet tall and walks on water.
Shut up, Dex.
[voice on PA] Please welcome District Governor Dr. Nyah Cable.
[cheers and applause]
[hopeful music playing]
For those of you turning 16 today,
you are truly on the cusp of a metamorphosis.
That change starts with one elegant procedure
that will make you perfect, both inside and out.
You’ll be beautiful and free
from hatred and discrimination based on the way that you look.
I am so excited for you to take your place in the city
and live the life you have been waiting for.
Will tomorrow’s Pretties please come forward?
[loud cheers]
Woo-hoo!
[hopeful music fades]
Peris…
[soft music plays]
The bridge. One month.
Don’t be late, though. Okay?
Deal.
[chuckles softly]
See ya, Squint.
See ya.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Hey.
Boyfriend?
Uh…
Best friend.
[hydraulics hissing]
Give me the toothbrush pill, please.




[wallscreen] One toothbrush pill.
[energy thrumming]
[distant banging, fizzing]
[voice on PA] Welcome, new students, to your first year at the dormitories.
[soft music playing]
[boy] Are you new here?
Yeah.
I’m Peris, but everyone calls me Nose.
I’m Tally.
But what are we going to call you?
You’ll certainly be prettier without those squinty eyes.
Squint.
Nose and Squint, I like it.
What’s wrong, Tally? Don’t you want gold eyes, like mine?
[young Peris] It’s like we’re invisible.
Let’s make a promise.
[young Tally] What kind of promise?
[young Peris] While we’re still like this…
Squint!
…we won’t be Ugly.
Squint!
[Peris] Ah!
To each other, we’ll be…
Enough.
Wait, Squint… Wait, wait.
[glass clinks]
[young Peris] Best friends forever.
[sighs]
[banging continue]
[soft music fades out]
During the time of the Rusties,
dependence on fossil fuel decimated the Earth,
poisoning our air, soil, and our water supply,
which resulted in division, conflict, and their ultimate collapse.
But, thankfully, our team of finest bioengineers
created a genetically modified flower, the White Tiger Orchid.
This miraculous plant decorates our countryside and powers our cities.

That’s a… That’s a great costume.
Thanks!
Yeah, except the Safari Party is actually down on the square.
Nose…
[dim trilling]
It’s me.
Tally, uh…
What are you… What are you doing here?
Well, you weren’t at the bridge…
Yeah, so you snuck in?
I was worried, and you’re never late.
Yeah, I don’t know. Things are just different here.
I didn’t really know what we’d talk about.
I mean, you’ll get it, when you’re Pretty.
We said, “Best friends forever.”
Maybe we will be.
In what? Two months?
[somber music plays]
Your scar.
You promised me.
I woke up from surgery, and then I realized I just…
didn’t really want it anymore, Tally.
Don’t call me Tally.
You… call me Squint.
Yeah.
[warbling]
[voice on PA] An unwelcome individual has been detected.

[warbling, thuds]
[laughing]
[panting]
That was insane!
I thought you were gonna fall off at that U-turn.
Yeah, so did I. And I don’t have a bungee jacket on this time.
Wait, what?
I jumped off Garbo. That’s why they were chasing me.
Wait, in a bungee jacket?
Yeah.
From how high?
Too high.
[both chuckle]
[grunting, panting]
You’re way cooler than you look.
Are you kidding me? You just lost a warden!
Ordinary Tuesday.
What were you doing by the river anyway?
Uh…
Just… tricks. [chuckles]
Do you want to go to the kitchen?
It’s locked.
So?
[scoffs]
How are we not already friends?
[upbeat music playing]
[can rattling, spraying]
But, like, don’t… Okay.
Wait, there’s cupcakes in this one.
This one? Okay.
How did you figure this out?
Cheers.
Mm. So good.
[squealing]
[music stops]
[Skinny] What was it like?
[Tally] Which part?
The party, the city, all of it.
You seem like someone that woulda snuck in before.
The Pleasure Gardens once, but…
[chuckles] The city city?
No one does that.
[sighs]
It’s like…
It’s everything they promised us.
What about your friend?
Was he the same, just Pretty?
I mean… it’s got to be kind of hard to see a face like this
after a month of not, you know?
It hurts being left behind.
You’ve got like a million friends. I’ve seen you.
All the ones I care about are… gone now.
Well, Skinny, you got me.
Well, for two months, anyway. [chuckles]
Wait, September?
Ninth.
[chuckles] No way.
We have the same birthday.
Stop. What?
Yeah!
Well, then you have me forever. What’s your real name?
What are they gonna call you after?
Shay.
Tally.
Mm.
What color eyes do you want, Shay?
I…
I don’t know.
I’m gonna get gold to match my hair.
Your hair is brown.
Not for long. [chuckles]
[wallscreen] Your metamorphosis class starts in ten minutes.
[knocking at door]
Hey.
Let’s go.
I know. We’re gonna be late for class.
Oh.
We’re not going to class.
Oh.
Yeah, is there, like, a beginner course? Or…
The more you ride, the more it learns your style.
Just gotta lean in and commit.
You make it sound so easy.
Get on that board, Tally.
And these work? For…
Yeah.
Once you get going, the crash bracelets work.
You got this. You’ll be a natural.
Whoa, that’s different.
[chuckles]
Yeah.
Yo, whoa… Okay…
Ooh. Hey.
Squeeze that core.
Okay.
Yeah.
You got it. Ready?
Okay.
Three, two, one…
[rapid warbling]
[grunts, groans]
[wheezing]
Yeah, not like that.
Oh my God.
[Shay] Walk it off.
You have to commit and believe, then it’ll happen.
But it’s mind over matter. I can’t figure that…
Like, how do you not be afraid even though you’re…
Skinny, hey!
Yeah. What’s up?
[laughs] It was incredible.
[Shay] I told you.
[reader] Is this really what The Smoke is like?
Is that a… a book?
You wanna read it?
[Tally] Um…
[laughing] Yeah, I want to read it.
Okay, whoa. Careful. He trusted me with that.
Who?
Wait, you’re Tally.
[bag zips shut]
Right?
Yeah.
Did you really jump off Garbo?
That’s…
Um…
Who did you tell?
Oh. Only… everyone.
[group chuckling]
Oh my God…
[Dex] So badass.
[chuckles]
What? It is badass.
They could deny my surgery.
They’re not gonna keep you from being Pretty.
You don’t know that.
They want you to be Pretty.
We all do with that face.
[chuckling]
[pensive music playing]
If you want to learn how to fly, you gotta learn how to fall.
Besides, I only know four kids who died from this.
Okay. Let’s go!
Why would you say that?
Hey. Focus.
Lean into it.
[chuckling lightly]
Find your balance.
Hey, Tally! You’re doing it.
Oh my God.
[both laughing]
[inhales] Whoo!
Wanna see a trick?
Uh… Yes. [chuckles]
Cup of water, please.
[wallscreen] Cup… Cup… Cup… Cup… Cup…
Cup… Cupcake.
[energy thrumming]
[dramatically] A cupcake.
[chuckles]
[laughing] Oh my God.
You should have seen the birthday party that I threw for Peris last year.
It was amazing.
[both laughing]
[Shay grunts softly]
Should I double my left side? ‘Cause my right side is…
I… I hate it. [chuckles]
Symmetry is overrated.
No, it’s not.
It’s an indication of health.
We’re biologically programmed to prefer it.
I like that. That’s good.
What’s your anonym? I want to add you.
I took down my account. I’m not on there.
What? Why?
It’s a time suck.
[laughs] What else do you have to do?

[song ends]
[Tally] I can’t believe we finally get to start our lives tomorrow.
Oh, by the way,
I loved it.
Yeah?
Yes, the seasons and then the water.
It sounds so beautiful. It makes me wish I could visit.
[inhales sharply] Would it be so bad not to do it?
The surgery?
[Tally] Shay, don’t talk that way.
We have to.
Do we?
What’s the alternative? Become all moldy and crinkly?
That goes against everything we’ve been taught.
I think age lines are kind of cool.
No, you don’t.
I do.
No, you don’t!
Tally. I do.
So you become a freak?
And live on a pond by yourself, harvesting beans like Thoreau?
Maybe I’d go to The Smoke.
That place is a myth, Skinny. It’s not a real place.
We’ve been at this school four years,
and we are by far the trickiest people here.
If The Smoke was real… we’d know about it.
Do… Do you know about it?
Meet me at the Greenbelt in two hours.
No. Wait, why? What are we doing?
One last trick.
[Tally] Shay. Shay!
What’s in the pack?
[tense music building]
Hey, you can’t go over there. The towers will detect us.
It’s okay. I’ve done it a bunch. Come on.
All right.
What are you doing?
Drop your ring on the branch.
They’ll think we’re having a picnic.
Our boards aren’t gonna work there. There’s no grid.
They’re magnetic. There’s metal in the river, minerals.
Just stick to the water. It’ll be fine.
Okay.
Where are we going?
You’ll see.
[adventurous music plays]
[chatting indistinctly]
[laughs] Oh, hoo-hoo!
[Shay howling]
[shouting] Whoo!
[laughs]
[Tally] I’ve never been in the Rusty Ruins before.
What is that?
Rusties called it a roller coaster.
Doesn’t work anymore, but it’s killer boarding.
Come on.
Trust me.
Okay.
[both laughing]
We have to head back soon. We’re gonna miss curfew.
Forget curfew.
Look at the ruins from here.
[music fades]
[quietly] Wow.
Tally… I need you to promise you’re not gonna tell anyone.
Tell anyone what?
Anything.
How to get here, how to call him.
Call who?
Just… promise.
Shay, you’re my friend. I promise.
Then here we go.
What is that?
Flint and steel. Bang them together, they spark.
[flames whooshing]
[tools clattering]
Shay, who are you calling?
David.
What?
He’s real, Tally. The Smoke is real, and he’ll be here any minute.
Are you kidding me? If we get caught, our surgeries are canceled,
and we’ll be completely alone.
I’m not getting the surgery.
I thought you were messing around this morning.
I wasn’t.
Okay, look. The Smoke? It’s… an alternative.
A different way of doing things.
Nobody judges you for how you look. It’s about who you are on the inside.
There are a lot of kids there from all different places.
That book you read? It’s like that.
It’s simple and beautiful. And…
Wait, you’ve been there?
Well, no. I… I mean, I met with David a bunch of times here.
But… the night you jumped off Garbo,
I was supposed to go with some of my friends.
I chickened out.
But then I met you,
and we did all those tricks, and I liked the way that felt.
I like reading books and making things, and they don’t do any of that in the city.
You get the procedure, they tell you what to do, and that’s it.
Shay…
Shay, I just think that you’re afraid to grow up.
I’m afraid to stop growing.
And I want you to come with me.
No.
Tally, look.
I have food for both of us. From the kitchen, like you showed me.
That’s not what that was for…
It’s four days away.
And they grow their own food there, Tally.
And I’ve heard it smells like the sea.
Shay…
And there are no Morphos or tablets.
I like tablets, and I like Morphos.
And everyone is exactly who they’re born to be. They’re free.
I don’t want to be free. I want to be Pretty!
That’s… I can’t.
I can’t.
Tally, please…
I’m so sick of feeling like I’m less than.
But you’re not.
I want people to see me.
I see you.
[solemn music playing]
[breathes deeply]
[sniffles, sighs]
I wrote directions, in a code only you’ll understand.
Just in case.
[Tally sighs]
That’s him.
Please don’t leave me.
Please.
[Shay] I have to.
[poignant music rises]
[music fades out]
[chiming]
[wallscreen] Good morning, Tally.
Congratulations.
[distant cheering]
[Cable] Beautiful and free
from hatred and discrimination based on the way that you look.
You’ve waited your entire lives for this moment.

[footsteps approaching]
[deep voice] Tally Youngblood?
Um, is something wrong?
[deep thrumming]
Would you tell me where we’re go… going, please?
Because if this is about the bungee jacket thing, then…
then I can explain that.
[dramatic music building]
[warbling]
[deep thrumming]
[music fades out]
[automated voice] Special Circumstances. Level 7.
[Cable] Hello, Tally.
I’m Dr. Cable. Please come in.
You know who I am?
I’m so sorry to delay your surgery.
I know how excruciating that can be.
But we need your help.
Shay’s missing. Please have a seat.
[Tally] Um…
That’s terrible.
You did realize she wasn’t in the waiting room.
I thought she must have been sick, you know, or something like that.
Is that what you thought?
[heartbeat thumping]
[Cable] Shay’s in danger.
I don’t know where she is.
We believe she’s been brainwashed. By a man named David.
He gets people to trust him, and then holds them against their will.
Help us.
The sooner you do, the sooner we can get to your procedure.
We have facilities right here.
Do you remember anything she said that would help us find her?
I wish I could help.
Well, maybe a night back at the dorms will help you remember?
Something may jog your memory.
[Tally] Um…
You’re…
You’re gonna send me back to the dorms?
Only until you can help. Just try to remember.
[somber music playing]
[girl 1] Hey, look who’s here. Why is she back?
[girl 2] She’s gonna be here forever.
[girls laughing]
[knocking]
Open, please.
Nose? Oh my gosh.
[laughs emotionally]
You just had to do it different, huh, Squint?
You have no idea how much I needed to see you.
[Tally sighs]
They’re after me about my friend Shay.
And apparently I can’t get the surgery until I tell them where she is.
So just tell them everything you know.
Well, yeah, but I made a promise to her.
But you also made a promise to me.
What am I supposed to do?
Squint, we spent every day for four years
dreaming of what it would be like in the city.
You’re supposed to be with me.
You haven’t even pinged me in three months,
and you were so weird last time.
It’s… It’s just different there.
You’ll feel different there.
Yeah, you said that already.
[sighs] Come on, Squint. What are you gonna do?
Refuse to help? Not get the surgery?
You would be a freak. A total outcast.
And besides, it sounds like she’s in actual danger.
[exhales sharply]
You’re not breaking a promise if she needs help.
[deep warbling]
I’m glad you decided to help us, Tally.
I’m going to tell you something only a handful of people know.
This man, David? The Smoke?
They’re developing a weapon to attack us.
[pensive music playing]
Why… Why would they want to do that?
They’ve decided their way of living is more worthy than ours.
So much so, they want us gone.
They plan to use this weapon to wipe out our city,
to destroy our way of life.
Shay is not… part of any of that.
She is now.
Don’t underestimate David. He’s brainwashed her.
Shay is under his power now.
And if she tries to leave, he will hurt her.
Or worse.
I need you to find The Smoke.
[tense music builds slowly]
[Cable] We need you to become one of them,
so we can find this weapon before it’s too late.
You have a choice to make, Tally.
You can get the procedure, as you’ve always wanted.
Or you can head into the unknown.
Save your friend.
Save us all.
[adventurous music playing]
“Take the coaster straight past the gap until you find one that’s long and flat.”
Look up.
[pulses]
Oh, wha… Ow!
[Cable] Once you’ve found the weapon, signal us with this necklace.
[grunting]
And we’ll be with you as swiftly as possible.
Shay needs you, Tally.
So do we.
[adventurous music rises]

[Cable] Thank you for coming to see me, Peris.
[Peris] You’re welcome, Dr. Cable.
I so appreciate your help convincing Tally.
She really needed you.
So she’s here?
No. She’s helping with one more thing.
Oh.
How did it… feel seeing her?
It actually felt kind of good being back there.
When I saw her, the strangest thing happened.
I started… feeling things.
[ambient music rises]
Things I hadn’t felt since before my surgery.
She reminded me of the way that I was.
Who I was. And I kinda missed that.
I… I know it sounds stupid. Because I’m here now.
But I’m still connected to her.
It doesn’t sound stupid, Peris.
And you’re not alone.
There are always a select few who need… more.
We’ve been working on a brand-new path for a select few just like you, Peris.
One that promises real clarity of thought.
I can make you very Special.
[music turns ominous]

[Cable] How does that sound?
Sounds great.
Thank you, Dr. Cable.

[coughing, wheezing]
Who are you?
I’m David.
I need your pack. You’re lucky we found you.
[adventurous music plays]
[beeping, trilling]
[beeping]
Oh. Tracker.
I had no idea that was there. I promise.
They always put trackers on boards. That’s how I found you.
Arms out.
[trilling]
Turn.
[gasping softly]
[trilling]
You’re clean.
Let’s go.
Yeah, okay.
[trills, beeping]
[music fades out]
We picked up the tracker from the hoverboard.
It seems to have been removed.
[Cable] Send two Specials.
Ten-kilometer radius.
She’s made contact.
Is this The Smoke?
It’s an outpost. Smoke’s still a day off.
We don’t take newcomers to The Smoke right away.
Why is that?
We need to vet them first.
[overlapping chatter]
Tally, this is Croy.
Hi.
[light music playing]
Tally?
Shay.
Shay!
Oh my gosh!
Oh my God. I’m so happy to see you!
I didn’t think you were coming.
Are you okay? Are you all right?
Am I okay?
Yeah.
Look at you, like you went to war.
I did! “The worst mistake.” Are you kidding me?
Yeah, honestly, I gave you like a 7% chance of getting it.
Whatever. God.
Come on. Let’s get you cleaned up.
I’m so tired.
[giggles] I can’t believe you’re here.
I know.
No one’s ever made it alone.
Nope.
You don’t find that suspicious?
Of course it is. But if she did do it alone, we need her.
[music fades out]
[Tally] Like, my whole body hurts so bad.
[laughs] Hey, I tried to get you to come with us.
[groans]
So you gonna tell me about that necklace?
Someone gave you that.
Who?
Uh… [chuckles]
Uh…
Peris came by my room that last night.
Wait.
I thought you guys were just friends.
We are.
But he gave you jewelry.
[chuckles]
It’s…
He wanted, just… He just wanted a way to recognize me after the surgery.
It’s not a big deal.
Okay. [chuckles softly]
You seem happy.
[inhales deeply]
I am.
I wasn’t expecting that.
What do you mean? Why not?
Well…
I… [sighs]
There’s something about this place, Shay. It’s just… It’s not what it seems.
Whoa, you… just got here.
No I know, but…
Wait.
Who even told you that?
I’m just scared for you. Okay?
[tense music playing]
Did you come here… to try to bring me back?
[sighs]
You need to leave.
First thing.
If you want to be Pretty, Tally, go be Pretty.
[Tally] No, wait. Wait, just wait. Maybe I just need some more time.
[Shay] No, that’s not how it works.
[Tally] Just give me a few days.
[sighs sharply]
[Tally] I’m sorry.
I am. I…
It’s just a lot to process, I guess.
I don’t know.
This is what we’re gonna do. I’m not gonna tell them about this.
It’s our secret, but you have to get to know these people.
Get to know The Smoke.
I know this is the right place for you,
but you have to give it an actual chance.
Okay?
Yeah.
You’ll find what you’re looking for.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
[bird squawking]
[David] This will be our last burn before we head back.
Okay, Croy, you’re spotting. And Ryde, you’re my co-pilot.
I’ll get started on the pre-flight check.
I’ll get some more supplies.
What’s happening?
We need to light some fires in the West Pass before we head home.
Wait, you set the fires?
Those orchids are toxic. They pull all the nutrients from the soil
and destroy everything in their path.
No. Those are the clean solution to the oil that the Rusties used.
[David] That’s what they want you to believe.
Those flowers are turning the planet into a wasteland. Killing everything.
Forcing everyone to live in the city. Come with us. See for yourself.
Sure you want to take her up? We don’t know this girl.
It’ll be good for her to see the truth. With her own eyes.
[chuckles lightly] I vouch for her.
[David] Come on.
It’s an old Rusty war machine. Retrofitted with solar.
Now it’s perfect for spreading fire.
[energetic music plays]
[helicopter whirs]
[David] Approaching West Mountain Pass.
Look down! You can see the line where the flowers end.
That was all once green.
[music intensifies]
Clear the field.
Yeah, all clear.
All right, Shay, you’re up!
All right.
[flames roaring]
[rapid beeping]
David. David, I see movement in the field.
[David] Are they ours or theirs?
Everyone, hold on. I’m going lower.
[screams]
Shay!
Shay!
Shay!
[Ryde] David, look down!
Wait, are those scouts?
They’re running into the flames!
They’re going after Shay!
Wait, wait, wait!
[music turns dramatic]
Tally, no!
[grunts]
I can’t see them. Get me lower.
[grunts]
Shay! Shay!
[alert whines]
David, we gotta pull up! We’re losing lift.
We are not leaving them.
Shay! [coughing]
Tally.
Tally!
[panting]
[grunts]
[groans]
[clanks]
Come on!
Pull up! Let’s go! Go! Go!
[clanks]
[music becomes solemn]
[music becomes heroic]
We got ’em!
[gasping]
Oh God.
[coughing]
[music fades]
[both coughing]
I just want to know how the scouts found us.
Right after… Miss Solo here makes her journey.
What?
Are you sure you didn’t have any help?
Are you kidding me, Croy?
These people want to end us, Shay.
[Croy scoffs]
Am I the only one that’s worried about all of this?
Huh?
You’re right that we don’t know about Tally.
But I just saw her risk her own life to save someone who we all care about.
Nobody dives out of a helicopter into fiery hell
unless they believe in something bigger than themselves.
That’s the cornerstone of The Smoke.
Pack up. We leave tomorrow.
[gentle music plays]
[Tally] But I told Shay I didn’t want to go.
And then I just show up by myself? Why would they believe me?
People believe what they want to believe.
Use that to your advantage.
[water splashing quietly]
[David] Voilà.
[softly] Wow.
Welcome to The Smoke.
[chuckles lightly]
Hold on.
Let’s go.
[hopeful music plays]
[David] I’m starving.
Yeah, me too.
[Shay] It’s harder than living in the city.
We grow our own food.
But you’ll be surprised how much better it tastes when you grow it yourself.
Everyone has to work, even our elders.
We don’t have money, so we share things and trade.
Stay warm.
Thank you.
Come on.
[Shay] But the most important thing?
Everyone is here because they choose to be here.
It’s exhilarating. And it’s real.
You keep your supplies in a cave?
It’s a safe house too. Tourmaline blocks their scanners.
[Shay] They used to be train tracks in the time of the Rusties.
But now we’re recycling the rail ties.
[Tally] To use it for what?
[Shay] Everything. Pots and pans. Gardening tools.
What about stuff like weapons?
[chuckles] I mean, in theory, but it’s not really our style.
[door creaking]
[Croy] Can I help you?
[gasps]
No. No, um…
I was… I was just looking for some water.
Water’s in the back. In the canteen.
Right. That makes sense.
Um…
This is…
Not your business.
[Shay] The change we’re after isn’t about guns or bombs.
It’s much bigger than that. You’ll see.
[metal squeaking]
Oh wait, hold on.
Hey.
Hey.
All right, your turn.
[music fades out]
What?
[both laugh]
Move a muscle, change a thought.
Your culture, they trap you in front of screens.
You never move.
I move.
[Shay] Hmm…
I snuck out, like, almost every night in the city.
[David] Oh, my bad.
Yeah.
[both chuckle]
Okay, fine.
Why don’t you give it a shot?
All right.
Put your foot here, hold it steady.
And crank it.
What do I… Is it okay to hold this?
Yes. Mm-hm.
Okay.
[ratcheting]
[clanking]
Wow.
That’s tough.
Really good.
Yeah, well, have at it.
I gotta feed the rabbits anyway.
See you in a little bit.
Okay.
[Tally grunts]
I move! [chuckles]
Ah…
See? I stand corrected, wow.
Is it what you pictured?
[indistinct chatter]
Um… not at all, actually.
[girl] Dinner is served. Everyone come and eat.
[chuckles softly]
[Croy] Shay. Here.
Thank you.
Here you go, Tally.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Yo, Len. Those carrots?
[man sighs]
[Len] Yes?
[coughing lightly]
[Shay] It’s not like the dorm food.
[coughs] I’m sorry.
I’ve just never had anything so spicy.
I used Croy’s hot chili.
Hey, that powder is only good for veggies, chili, and bear attacks.
Bears?
[Croy] Yeah.
[laughter]
Can I have everyone’s attention, please?
Shh…
Quiet.
Guys, guys…
[chattering stops]
Scouts were spotted in the West Pass last night.
That’s the closest they’ve ever come.
We stopped them.
[solemn music playing]
But it wasn’t easy.
The city is not going to stop.
Because The Smoke is a threat to everything they stand for.
Our time here is limited.
We must achieve our objective.
Where we believe in preserving what’s natural,
they believe in manipulation.
Before you came here, how many times a day did you think about how you looked,
what’s wrong with you?
They make us feel so alone and so insecure
that we don’t have time for things that actually matter.
Thinking, reading, learning, dreaming.
Choosing who you become.
[music builds intensity]
And I’m not okay with that.
[muted cheers]
[David] And you’re not okay with that.
And we will do whatever it takes to protect that.
[Croy] Yes!
[cheers and applause]
[music fades out]
Close one eye.
Aim it just above the center.
All right?
Okay.
Okay. Here.
Okay.
[David] Yes. Safety. Yep.
Okay.
Okay. So… hold it like…
Ouch.
Oh…
Those are some serious blisters.
[Tally] Yeah.
That from the jack?
Well, you know, using a Morpho-pad doesn’t exactly require a thick skin.
We could come back when you’re healed.
No, no, no.
I… I really want to get this.
All right.
[arrow whistles]
[bird chirps]
You know, maybe close the other eye.
Rude.
[chuckling]
[light, pensive music plays]
We could come back.
No, we’re going again.
All right.
[music stops]
Yes!
[laughs] Ooh!
Wow. That was nice!
Thank you.
You never quit, do you?
Do you ever miss the city?
I’ve never lived there.
I was born here.
Your parents live here?
Raised me themselves.
I barely know my parents.
Last time I saw them they asked for my Morpho
so they could find me after surgery.
I’m sorry.
It’s normal for parents to want that.
It’s not, Tally.
Wait just one second.
[gentle music plays]
In place of that thick skin.
For me?
Mm-hm.
Thank you.
Of course.
These are amazing. Thank you so much.
[Len] Hey! Make some room!
[Croy] David!
[Len] Make some room! We need help here!
[grunting, groaning]
It’s okay. I got you.
You okay?
Yeah.
What happened?
We got company while burning the flowers.
But we drew them as far away as we could.
Sailor?
Scouts.
It’s all right. We’re safe now.
These weren’t normal scouts. They weren’t regular Pretties.
They were fast. Too fast.
I’ve never seen anything like them.
I saw them run through fire.
You need to wrap that and help it clot.
Here.
Thank you.
Is this the fire jumper? Croy said you made it here by yourself.
You sick of telling that story yet?
Are those David’s gloves?
Yeah.
I had, um, started getting blisters on my hand.
Wait, he gave them to you?
Yeah, is that…
I don’t understand.
Objects have a different value here, Tally.
He made those. They didn’t come out of some wall.
People think really hard about the gifts they give.
He likes you.
What?
It’s time for you to make a choice.
Are you staying or not?
I’ll, um… I’ll give these back.
I don’t need them.
It’s not about that.
Keep them. Give them back.
Wear the necklace. Don’t.
Choose The Smoke. Don’t choose The Smoke.
I want you here.
But it’s not fair to me or David or anyone else for you to have one foot in
and one foot out anymore.
[solemn music plays]
[Croy] Long day, huh?
Right? [chuckles]
[indistinct overlapping chatter]
[David] What made you change your mind?
Shay told me you didn’t want to come.
And then you did.
[music fades out]
Um, I guess I just want to choose who I become. You know?
Wasn’t easy, though. Some say that you radicalize people.
[David chuckles]
That’s fair.
All social change is seen as radical at first.
That’s not what I mean.
What do you mean?
They say that you have a weapon.
[tense music builds slowly]
That…
That you’re planning to wipe out the city.
Come on.
[light music playing]
[music fades out]
David?
David! Hey.
What, you miss our cooking or something?
[chuckles] Tally, these are my parents.
Hi, nice to meet you.
You too.
[David] Tally thinks we have a weapon.
I’ll put the kettle on.
[dad] Come on in.
Wait, this was yours?
You should read “Civil Disobedience.” It’s even better.
[mom] You need a haircut.
[David] Dad needs a haircut.
[dad] Hey, don’t encourage her.
Last time I let her trim it, I nearly lost an ear.
[mom] Not true!
Kind of true.
[both chuckle]
Sorry, I’m sorry.
It’s okay.
[Tally] But you both look so much like David.
I’ve just never really seen that before.
Your eyes, and your smile.
That’s why he’s so handsome.
Ah… Okay…
I didn’t say you were perfect. You still got the family freckles.
[all chuckling]
Have a seat, love.
Thank you.
So… what can we help with?
[David] Um…
I want to tell her.
Son, I don’t… I don’t think she’s been here long enough.
She can handle it.
I trust her.
Before The Smoke, they were doctors.
[mom] Cosmetic surgeons working for the State.
The last year we lived in town,
I was appointed to the committee for morphological standards.
So I had access to the entire medical database.
[dad] Meanwhile, I was trying to make the operation safer.
What do you mean?
[exhales]
We were seeing several deaths a year.
That’s not bad for a surgery that serious. But I wanted to do better.
People have died from it?
I…
I never knew that.
They keep it quiet.
That’s when I first noticed this pattern of lesions in the brain.
These lesions in the frontal cortex, they dull you.
You don’t care about anything. You can’t think clearly.
You’re sedated into a false sense of happiness.
I… I don’t understand.
They erase who you are.
[mom] And when we realized that, Cable showed up,
told us to stop digging, and took all our research.
That’s when we knew the lesions were not a side effect of the surgery.
They were the purpose.
But…
But why would Cable do that?
To control us.
[mom] Cable wasn’t always like this. We were colleagues. Friends.
We’d all been given the surgery at the same time,
but we were strong-willed, rebellious.
So we were invited to the inner circle where we were given a cure
to make us whole thinkers again.
Not everyone is that lucky to be doctors.
Others get additional surgery, and become mindless soldiers.
Az and I couldn’t sit back and watch it happen.
We knew it was wrong. So we fled.
We stopped getting the surgeries and decided to age naturally.
And here we are. Offering free thought and self-acceptance as an alternative.
And dedicating the rest of our lives to recreate the cure.
So have you… have you found…
Have you found it? Can you cure the lesions?
We’re close.
But there’s still that synthetic component we just don’t have out here.
But… we have created, in our lab, the base serum.
When the two are combined properly, we’ll be able to heal the lesions.
It would be the ultimate weapon against Dr. Cable.
They have the nanosynth in the city, but it’s too dangerous to get in there.
Az is working on a substitute.
When we find it, we’ll have to run tests, and find volunteers for the trials.
Why don’t you just kidnap some Pretties if they’re not in their right mind anyway?
No, we can’t force this on them. And we don’t even know if it’s safe.
[mom] This is the brain we’re talking about, alright? It’s complicated.
There’s all kinds of side effects. Seizures, brain damage…
Death.
[mom] For the last 20 years, we’ve been working on replicating this cure.
And Cable knows it. It’s why she’s closing in.
[dramatic music builds]
[music fades]
David, um…
I haven’t been completely honest with you.
I didn’t come here for The Smoke.
I mean, I came here for myself. I don’t know how to say this. I just…
I was told these lies my whole life, and believed every word.
And I have done things and…
Tally…
I brought you here and told you everything tonight because I know who you are today.
Stop being so nice to me.
Stop thinking about what your parents want.
What the city wants. What The Smoke wants.
What do you want?
I’ve just done so many bad things.
I just thought in all the wrong ways.
It makes me feel like maybe I am just Ugly.
No.
What you do,
the way you think,
makes you beautiful.
[crackling, sparking]
[birds chirping]
[deep warbling approaches]
[Tally panting]
[teen 1] Scouts!
[tense music playing]
Scouts! Scouts!
[clamoring]
Tally! David!
Tally, come on!
Get over here.
[both grunt]
[shouts]
[grunts, groans]
[both panting]
We gotta do something.
No, no, no. David! David!
They’re too strong. We need to find another way.
[shouting]
[deep thrumming]
[distant screaming]
[teen 2] Get your hands off me! [grunts]
[panting]
Let me go!
Get down.
[exhales]
[music turns ominous]
[breathing shakily]
[mom] Nyah!
Get off me.
This is enough!
It’s time to let people choose.
[Cable] I’ve seen your lab, Maddy.
You only want there to be one choice.
Yours.
[David] We gotta do something.
Stay… Stay here, please.
Where is he? Your son.
The leader of this rebellion.
He has nothing to do with this.
He has everything to do with this.
He’s trying to destroy everything we’ve built.
Where is he?
[Croy breathes heavily]
I’ll ask you one more time.
[slowly] Where is your son?
Just him.
[trembling] No, wait.
Nyah, wait. Don’t do this.
What are you doing?
Peris…
[Maddy] Nyah, please…
What are you doing?
Peris, don’t! Peris, don’t!
[David] No! No! No!
Get your hands off me.
No, please!
[cracks]
[all screaming]
[David] No!
[crying]
[clamoring]
[Maddy sobbing intensely]
[gasping sobs]
Peris…
[Maddy sobbing] No…
[Cable] Thank you for joining us, Tally.
[crying] You… You didn’t tell me that you would hurt anyone.
You didn’t tell me.
[gasps] Tally…
I vouched for you.
[captives exclaiming]
[overlapping shouts]
You performed beautifully, Tally.
I knew you would.
Your procedure has been scheduled.
In fact, all of your procedures have been scheduled.
[captives protesting]
Traitor!
[tense music builds]
[Maddy] Wait, no. No.
[pounding]
[door rattling]
[grunting]
David, run! Run! Go!
Let her go.
She’ll come to me.
Round up all the prisoners.
No!
Smash Maddy’s lab, and everything in it.
Destroy The Smoke once and for all.
[deep warbling]
[breathing deeply]
[music fades]
[thrumming fades to distance]
David…
[grunts] Why?
Listen. I tried to destroy the pendant.
I didn’t know that it would call them. I didn’t know!
I’m sorry.
Croy was right. You… You lied. Every word was a lie, Tally.
They made me. They threatened me.
What did they threaten you with? Did they say they would hurt Shay?
They said that you would hurt Shay. That you would hurt everyone.
I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I fell in love with this place.
I never knew that there was a way that you could live, and be yourself,
and that would be enough, or that the cost of becoming Pretty was your mind.
I would die before I’d let them turn me now.
David, I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry.
What’s your plan?
I’m going to get them.
I’m coming with you.
No, you’re not.
David, you’ve never been to the city.
I have.
Your mother is being taken to a building I’ve been inside of.
A building I know how to get into.
Please, let me make this right.
I don’t trust you.
You don’t have to trust me.
You just have to follow me.
[dramatic music builds]
[heavy whirring]
[music fades out]
“Library.” You’re missing the first “R.”
Libraries…
“…braries.” Yeah. And books were free.
Sussy. Sussy!
Tally! We heard The Smoke was destroyed.
An and I lit the flame in the ruins two days ago. No one came.
Because it isn’t real.
Dude…
David!
You don’t exist.
Don’t hurt me.
You’re David? That’s David?
I’m David.
We need your help.
Okay, guys, listen. Sussy, I need your interface ring, please.
I need you guys to gather as many kids as you can and create a diversion.
Okay?
[Sussy] Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
You wanna be rebels? Today’s your day.
“The Smoke Lives.” Write it in the sky. Come on.
[chuckles] Let’s go!
I knew it!
That was… That was David!

I’m here.

They took her to surgery.
No.
[Croy] We’re too late. It’s over.
No, it’s not.
I know… I know you have no reason to trust me.
But we have to save Shay.
I have an idea.
And it’s gonna take all of us.

Shay?
Right here. Here. Here.

Shay!
Right here. Right here.

Tally!
Do you love it?
I got to be first because I made the most trouble.
You should have seen me kicking and screaming.
I nearly scratched out a nurse’s eye.
Tally… Breathe. [chuckles]
Shay, your eyes.
Golden. Just like you always wanted.
You’re not jealous, are you?
[softly] I’m so sorry, Shay.
Don’t apologize.
You were right.
It is the most… incredible feeling, looking this way.
[chuckles]
[door whirring]
Peris.
[Cable] She is breathtaking, isn’t she?
You have a choice to make.
I suggest you choose surgery.
[slow, tense music playing]
All right. I’m going.
[energy pulsing]
Freethinking is a cancer, Tally.
Leave people to choose for themselves,
and they’ll destroy the world.
They nearly did.
Freeing them of choice saved them.
Humanity needs to be led.
And there are those of us who are fit to lead.
People are so much happier this way.
You’ll be happier this way.
But I won’t be me.
No.
But you sure will be Pretty.

Oh man…
All right, Croy.
Is everybody all right?
Yeah. Thanks to you both.
But, guys. We got it. We got what we need for the cure.
No, they destroyed your lab, Mom. The research is gone.
No. Your pouch.
What?
Your pouch.
Enough to replicate. I grabbed the nanosynth from Cable’s lab.
So I think I can complete the formula now.
Does that mean… Well, does that mean we can cure Shay?
But I don’t want to be cured.
No, you’re… you’re…
This isn’t you, Shay.
[scoffing] Me? Look at you guys.
Running around these ruins like a bunch of Rusties.
You’re all… full of paranoia,
fear, jealousy…
You weren’t always like this, Shay.
No.
I used to be Ugly.
I’m only here because I feel bad for Tally.
If I hadn’t told her about The Smoke, you would be Pretty. Right now.
[Croy] We don’t have time for this.
Why don’t we take her with us and make her take it?
No.
We can’t. We don’t know if it’s safe.
She’s not herself, Mom.
Honey, we are not gonna perform medical experiments on an unwilling subject.
That’s the difference between us and them.
I’ll do it.
What?
I’ll be your test subject.
They’ll turn me and… and then you’ll turn me back.
Tally, no.
Maddy, please. Shay can’t choose anymore, but I can.
And I want you to do it.
Cable could kill you, Tally.
I know.
Honey, there are risks.
You have the cure. And if it works, then maybe we could convince Shay,
and maybe we can convince everybody else.
That’s how we change the world.
It’s worth it.
No.
We’ll lose you like we lost Shay.
[sighs] No, you won’t.
I’m strong.
It took me a long time, but I… I know who I am now.
I’m not gonna let them take that away from me.
How will we know it’s still you?
I’ll leave you a sign.
I’m sorry you were right about me.
I wasn’t, actually.
Thank you.
[Maddy] They’re coming.
If you come back, then I’ll know that you’ve forgiven me.
[breathes deeply]
You are so beautiful.
Go.
Go.
[suspenseful music builds slowly]
I’m so sorry, Shay.
I’m gonna make this right.
[deep thrumming]
[epic music rises]
I’m Tally Youngblood!
Make me Pretty.
[music peaks and fades out]
[gentle music plays]
[footsteps approaching]
[wallscreen] Welcome to your new home.
Would you like the lighting adjusted?
[Tally] No, it’s perfect as it is.
I’d like to check your health and wellness status.
Would that be all right?
Go ahead.
Are you healing properly from your procedure?
Yes.
Are you experiencing any anxiety or discomfort?
No, none at all.
And how do you feel today?
I feel at peace.
Are you satisfied with the outcome of your surgery?
Yes.
I love the new me.
I love being Pretty.

[distant police siren wailing]
Well?
I don’t know. They’re still following us.
[woman 1] That’s Jesi, and I’m Angela.
A week ago, we didn’t know each other.
Hold on.
[Angela] The police are chasing us.
Mobsters are chasing us.
Okay, go.
[Angela] We’re two fugitives now.
And this suitcase is our biggest problem.
[Angela] Wait! Jésica!
…or our salvation.
[intriguing music playing]
[Angela] This is a little girl… who was alone and bored because she didn’t have anyone to play with.
MONDAY
But suddenly, she found another girl who was just like her, so then they played together and had lots of fun.
[children screaming, chattering]
But just then, they realized that they were only glitter glue drawings.
[man 1] Like this. See?
[man 2] Twelve ready.
Ask Vanesa to explain to you how combos work.




What was your name again?
Jésica, but they call me Jesi.
Vane.
[man 2] Got that?
Tell Jésica what she should be doing, please.
[intriguing music continues]

Oh!
What happened?

Um, excuse me.
What are you doing here?
I live here, Mom.

[sighs]
[mom] As if you’re crushing the most horrible bug you’ve ever seen in your life.
Good, really flatten it.

[mom] No, it’s inhale and exhale. If you just exhale, you’ll hyperventilate.
Come on. Let’s go again.

You’re hyperventilating. Long breaths.
Oh my… Coming through. Sorry.

Give it to me. It must be the doctor.
[Jésica] Excuse me.
Hello?
Could I trouble you to let me out?
[mom] No. Jesi, take it. It’s for you. Make it quick.
[Jésica] Who is it?
How should I know?
Let’s bring the uterus to the floor.
Hello?
Come on. Ooh, ah.
[Jésica] Yes.
[students] Ooh, ah! Ooh, ah! Ooh, ah!
Uh…
Ooh, ah! Ooh, ah! Ooh, ah!
[Jésica] I understand.
Okay.

Uh, where’s Florencio Varela?




[chanting stops]
[mom] Why?
Dad kicked the bucket.
[students moan]
Wasn’t he already dead?
[screaming]
[scream echoes, fades]
I just talked to him a couple of weeks ago.
He told me he missed me and wanted to see me.
He sounded sincere.
[man on TV] …bus, the train.
They’re laughing in our faces.
And after that, they go home
to the lap of luxury that is their apartment in Puerto Madero.
Politicians?
Marcelo, can you turn the TV down? That’s what they are.
I can’t listen to this guy now.
…liars, scumbags, idiots!
Listen. I have to go to work, Piru. Do you know how much longer?
You wanna go? Go ahead.
I can’t get a signal here.
Then go, Marcelo! Get outta here.
Okay. I’ll be right back.
[tense music playing]
Are there any Di Pace relatives here?
Me. His daughter.
I’m also his daughter.
[doctor] This way, please.
[uneasy music playing]
[door closes]
[woman] Doctor?
I’ll be right back.
[door closes]
What are you doing?
Hey!
I’m curious.
I’ve never seen a dead person.
Do we look alike?
No.
Maybe a little though, huh?
Like, around the mouth maybe?
He looks nothing like you.
What are you doing here?
He doesn’t resemble you either.
[door opens]
Well, girls,
are you able to identify the body?
No. No clue.
[doctor] What about you?
No. Me neither.




[doctor] But I don’t understand.
Aren’t you his daughters?
He should have a mole on his neck. Uh, I’ve got one in the same place.
Is it possible to turn him over?
Yes.
No need, Doctor. I can confirm it.
This man is Ernesto Alejandro Di Pace.
Oh, I don’t want to remember him like this.
Can you cover him?
Very well.
Who are you exactly?
I’m Inesita Alvarez Ballesta.
I’ve been your father’s private secretary for more than 25 years.
[Jésica] Did he leave us anything?
[Inesita] He was very disappointed
by that completely false accusation made against him.
What accusation?
About the Osterfil case.
You didn’t know?
To your father, this insolence was unforgivable.
Dr. Di Pace was a very righteous, generous man.
He was a doctor?
I wish he and I could’ve spent more time together.
And I bet he did too. No doubt.
Do you recall that vacation to Brazil?
Brazil?
[Inesita] To Camboriú.
You were very young.
He spent the whole day with you.
Swam in the ocean with you.
Put sunscreen on your nose.
Made sandcastles with you.
Don’t you remember?
Yeah, maybe a little.
We lost a real patriot, girls.
The two of you should be very proud of your father.
You’re right.
Yeah, but do we get anything?
Can you show some respect?
Is that all you care about?
Wait, wait.
Of course that’s all I care about.
Tell me, what exactly do you mean when you ask that question, darling?
I don’t know. Like a watch or a television or land.
Well, as far as that goes,
the only asset he had to his name was the apartment.
You’ve been there, right?
[both] No.
[Inesita] If you’d like me to, I can take you to see it
after the funeral tomorrow.




Now go relax. Hmm?
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Take care.
Thank you.
I’m Jésica.
But they call me Jesi.
[somber music playing]
[Jésica] See you tomorrow, Angela!
Who’s that?
No one.
Come on, Marcelo!
[man] Ernesto was
loyal,
short-tempered,
a comrade in activism
who worked for the common good.
We’re gonna miss you, Ernesto.
Men like you
are a dying breed.
Goodbye, my comrade.

These are Dr. Di Pace’s daughters.
Angela and, um…
Jesi.
Jésica.
Jesi.
The mayors.
Omar Chichi and Ezequiel Barzenac.
Good friends of your father’s.
Darlings, my condolences.
Your father was always like a son to me.
Yes, but for me, he was more… more like a father.
Where do you two live?
I’m from Valentín Alsina.
Castelar, near Ituzaingó.
Well, I want you both to know you can count on me for anything you need.
Positively anything.
Got that?
[rhythmic pop music playing]
[Angela] When I was little, he worked at city hall.
[Inesita] Mm.
[Ángela] After that, I don’t know.
I sort of lost track.
Wasn’t he a subsecretary of something?
[Inesita] Yes, yes, but that didn’t last long though.
He preferred being on the street in direct contact with others.
Mm. But these days, what was he doing?
Well, he was…
he was a…
a facilitator.
Because everything in this country is hard.
Things are much too difficult here.
Really difficult.
[Jésica] Where is the apartment?
Two blocks away, in Puerto Madero.
Huh.
Huh.
[optimistic music playing]
[Inesita] Hey!
Avellaneda was his whole life.
It was his little corner of the world.
But anyway, he would always say,
“God may be everywhere, but he caters to Puerto Madero.”
All right. Come in, girls.
How does this work again?
It’s a smart apartment, and so this tablet controls everything.
[optimistic music continues]
[phone ringing]
[Inesita] Oh, sorry, girls.
One minute.
Yeah, yeah, I have to take this call. Excuse me. Hello?
Yes.
Right now? Does it have to be today?
[Jésica] What’s a facilitator?
[Inesita] No, no, no. I’m tied up at the moment.
Um, a facilitator facilitates things, obviously.
But what kinda things?
Who knows? Why do you keep asking me?
Uh-huh. Okay, I’ll be right there.
My apologies, girls. Something important just came up.
We need to come back another day.
[Jésica] I’m staying.
Why do you wanna stay here?
Because I wanna stay.
So maybe I’ll stay too.
Can we?
I mean, won’t this apartment be ours sooner or later?
[Inesita] In theory, yes.
But we’ll have to start the inheritance procedure.
And in practice?
It’s inhibited by the judiciary.
What’s “enibited” by the judiciary?
[both] Inhibited.
[Inesita] It’s because of the Osterfil case.
We have to see how it’s resolved.
And because of how slow the court system is here, it might even take years.
Years? Are you kidding me?
Would you please calm down?
But what are you saying?
Dad did have a lawsuit filed against him?
It was a made-up lawsuit, sweetheart.
It was drummed up by some scoundrels to get him out of the way.
But then the judge took these measures and…
We need to have faith.
Your father was a man who…
I need to stay here, ma’am.
I mean, because I really miss him, and I’d like to remember him.
All of us miss him.
Precisely.
So I’d like to spend some time here with his belongings.
I’m his daughter. I have rights, don’t I?
Ah.
Yes. Rights.
Okay, you can stay a while.
Don’t make a racket. The neighbors are a little fussy. Hmm?
We won’t stay long.
[Inesita] Mm.
I’ll drop off the keys when we’re done.
That’s okay. I’ll be in touch with you.
Thank you.
[Inesita] Don’t break anything, okay?
See you later, girls.
[door opens]
[door closes]
We have the same hoodie. See?
[wistful music playing]
[seagulls chirping]
[waves crashing]
[children laughing]
[upbeat pop music playing]
Well, shall I bring you a fernecito?
I got one already, thanks.
[Angela] Where’d you get that?
There’s a minibar there.
And there’s beer in the fridge if you want.
But… Okay, but… Jésica, was it?
We just got back from the funeral.
We can’t drink his alcohol and live in his place
like nothing happened.
So?
So what?
We’re leaving.
Go ahead. I’m staying here.
All right, I’m taking the keys.
Wait, how am I gonna get out? Throw myself out the window?
You could.
[tablet beeps]
Okay, dude.
[music stops]
Be real with me. What’s your problem?
Everything’s all right. I just wanna go.
No, it’s not all right.
Eight years ago, I friended you on Facebook, and you ignored me.
Now I have to deal with you scowling at me like I’m guilty of something?
What’s the deal?
I won’t look at you if you don’t want me to.
Oh Jesus!
How do you lower the blinds?
How should I know how to lower the blinds?
How did she do it when we first came in?
Angela! I’m talking to you.
“Smart Haus.”
Huh?
Angela, don’t walk away when I’m talking to you!
Hey!
You can’t blame me because your papi’s condom broke, okay?
I wasn’t around to stop it! Sorry!
What are you doing?
Angela, have you ever finished a conversation?
You want me to apologize for existing? I’m sorry!
Okay, Jésica. I’ll make it clear.
You and I aren’t gonna be friends on Facebook, real life, or anywhere.
How about Instagram?
You do Instagram?
Are you deaf to my voice?
[sighs]
I’ll make it simple so you can follow along.
We’re gonna leave the apartment.
We’re gonna try to figure out what’s going on with it,
and, if possible, we’ll sell it.
And then we can split the money and go our separate ways
just like we did before.
Okay.
You don’t have to be my friend.
We’ll just be sisters.
No! You’re not my sister! You’re nothing to me.
Don’t you get it? You’re not on my radar. You don’t exist.
Do I have to message you on Facebook?
Well, you don’t exist for me either.
Jerk.
Great. Neither one of us exists.
That’s perfect.

[mysterious music playing]
[electronic beeping]
What the hell?
Is this happening, or am I imagining it?
It’s happening.
[Jésica] But… it’s…
[Angela] Yes.
It’s a buttload of euros.
What the hell? But…
Mm, I don’t know. Uh, looks like he saved a lot.
Uh-huh. Or he was a corrupt asshole.
You don’t know that.
Don’t touch.
Why not?
You might leave fingerprints.
You can go to prison for this kinda thing.
You said it was savings.
[mysterious music continues]
We should go.
[soothing elevator music playing]
[Angela] Go home, and we’ll talk later.
When?
I dunno.
I need to think. Just do what I say.
[sighs]
What’s your number?
Just tell me, Jésica!
Mm. I don’t remember it.
How can you use this with a broken screen?
Yeah, I know. I keep dropping it.
Now you have my number.
Can I call you?
No!
Go home. Don’t tell anyone.
Meet me here tomorrow.
[elevator dings]
[automated voice] Please be careful when entering and exiting the elevator.
[elevator dings] Have a wonderful day.
[radio beeps]
[man 1] Copy. I’ll make the usual rounds. Over.
[radio beeps]
What about the keys?
I got the keys.
Why you?
[sighs] You want a key? Okay.
You take upstairs. I’ll take downstairs.
And the entrance?
Rock, paper, scissors.
Jésica.
What?
[whimsical music playing]
[both] Rock, paper, scissors.
[both] Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors.
Ugh! You’re so annoying! Just take the key already. Take it.
Thanks a lot.
[toilet flushing]
MATERN TEST QUICK PREGNANCY TEST
What’s up, Piru?
[gasps] What the hell, jackass?
You scared me.
When did you get here?
Just now.
Oh.
Look at this, babe.
They gave it to me at work.
I can see what’s going on in every building all the time. Look.
Caballito, Berazategui, Villa Crespo…
Why do you need to see what’s going on everywhere?
What do you mean?
You know those delinquents, Piru.
You never know when they’re gonna strike.
I’m gonna make maté. [sighs]
[sighs]

[door opens]
[snoring continues]
[mom] Jesi.
Did you see I bought some pregnancy gear?
I ran out of cash.
Did you get paid yet? Could you lend me some money?
I just started, Mom. I haven’t gotten paid.
What about an advance?
Are you crazy?
Ask Beto.
No.
No. Beto’s got his own problems. No.
[whispers] What about this jackass?
No.
Beto’s in charge of his kid. I’m in charge of you.
I don’t wanna mix it up.
[Jésica sighs]
How was your father’s funeral?
Good.
Normal.
You in the will?
Is that all you care about?
No, Jesi. That is not all I care about.
[sighs]
Well, I’ll figure it out.
Mm.
[Marcelo] What’s up, Piru?
Look, it’s me and my dad in Camboriú.
It’s an amazing castle, huh? [chuckles]
How were we able to do it?
I have something to tell you. But don’t tell anyone else.
Marce.
Hang on ’till I reply to this bastard on Twitter.
Okay.
What do you wanna tell me?
Nothing.
WEDNESDAY
[pensive music playing]
You gotta be kidding me, dude!
[children screaming]
[music intensifies]
[man] How much longer for my order, sweetheart?
[Jésica] Let me check.
[woman] I’ve been waiting ten minutes.
One sec.
[man] Are they slaughtering the cow?
No. Sorry. No, uh…
[woman] Where’s the mayonnaise?
I’ll take care of it.
DONATIONS
[woman 1] Did the guy show up after all?
[woman 2] Yes, he came, but…
[woman 1] Well?
We won’t be able to do it.
At least not this year.
[woman 1] Aw, the roof’s going to cave in!
[woman 2] Well, anyway…
Another pizzeria in the neighborhood.
For Christ’s sake!
[woman 1] Just what we need.
I guess they’re just trying their best.
[woman 2] We all do, my love.
Yes.
This country is difficult.
Difficult. [sighs]
Tell me, how are your classes going?
Mm…
Good.
I guess. Pretty good.
[laughs]
My dear! [laughs]
She’s just like her mother!
She was a horrible liar too. Remember, Bubi?
It’s genetic.
[woman 1] Yeah.
Hopefully, that’s not all I inherited.
Yes, yes!
Your mom had so much faith in you, and so do we.
Yes, so much faith.
So much faith, darling. So much faith in you.
[mysterious music playing]
You didn’t tell anyone, did you?
No, I don’t think so.
Me neither.
What do you mean “think”? Did you, or didn’t you?
No, I said no.
Good.
I suppose.
Yes or no, Jésica?
No, I didn’t tell anyone.
So?
So what?
So what do we do?
I don’t know!
But we obviously can’t keep this money.
Angela, you know I’m broke as shit, okay.
It’s just that we don’t know where it came from.
It could be stolen money.
Did you steal it?
No.
Good, me either.
Okay, but someone stole it.
Probably Dad.
Would you do me a favor?
Don’t talk about Dad like that.
I don’t know what your relationship was like,
but my dad, the one I knew, was a good man,
and I wanna remember him that way.
Plus, we don’t know if that’s his money,
or someone else’s,
or if they’ll come looking for it, or what. We don’t know anything.
[sighs]
There was no relationship.
I don’t care.
[sighs]
Well, what do we do?
I don’t know.
I’m trying to think.
[sighs]
Are you hungry?
There is this hot dog stand two blocks away.
Hot dogs sound good.
[pop music plays on radio]
I’ll leave it here.
Thanks.
[man 1] Hey, what’s happening, man?
[Angela] This neighborhood is overpriced.
[man 2] That’s good. Ready to head inside?
Please don’t be mad.
What?
[tense music playing]
FINKEN RESTAURANT
[funky music playing]
So you didn’t really know him, did you?
Who?
Our father! Who else?
Mm.
No, not really.
You neither, right?
Sure I did.
You didn’t recognize him at the hospital.
Well, I hadn’t seen Dad in 15 years.
But I know we loved each other.
And what do you do for work?
I’m a kindergarten teacher. I graduated last year.
That’s nice.
You?
Gastronomy.
You’re a cook?
[coughing]
[Jésica] Excuse me. Do you have mayonnaise?
Sh! Hey! Don’t shout.
Especially not for mayonnaise.
Are you always this paranoid, Angela?
You don’t get what’s happening, do you?
You know what I don’t get? This food I ordered.
Tell me what this is.
What is this? Tell me.
Aren’t you curious about the money?
Where it came from, and whose it is?
What are you most afraid of?
That somebody’s gonna want it back.
No one’s going to want it back, Angela.
[Barzenac] Good evening.
How are you?
[Jésica] Great.
I’m Ezequiel Barzenac.
We met at your father’s funeral.
Yes. How are you?
What are you doing here?
I live just around the corner, on Macacha Güemes.
Sorry, but aren’t you like the…
Mayor. Yes.
What does that have to do with anything?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Certainly doesn’t matter, right?
Mm-mm.
Well, when you’re done with your meal, if you want a glass of champagne,
come join me at my table.
I’m with a good friend of your father’s, Mr. Osterfil.
[unsettling music playing]
[Barzenac] One more thing.
Why don’t you keep our secret safe, huh?
What secret?
The best shirako in Buenos Aires, right?
Mm.
Ah. Shirako.
Shirako. Semen from fish.
Semen?
From fish.
Mm.
[chuckles]
[coughs]
Disgusting, God!
Rich people are so weird!
We have to go now.
Huh?
Get up, we’re leaving.
Why are we always leaving places?
Enjoy.
[unsettling music continues]
We have to go. How much do we owe you?
[cashier] Is there a problem?
No, it was really good. Uh, we just have to leave now because…
We have business to attend to.
Okay, but your check has already been paid for, ladies.
Your meals were compliments of Mr. Osterfil.
[unsettling music continues]
[Angela] That guy is accused of bribery in Dad’s lawsuit.
But was he the one who gave Dad the money?
I don’t know. I don’t know, but he just paid for our dinner.
And why did he do that? To make us accomplices.
Would you calm down a minute and pull yourself together?
How could they know we found the money?
How else could we afford that restaurant?
What? We’re not allowed to have money?
Have you seen how you’re dressed?
Excuse me, Lady Di.
Well, that’s the point. We’re out of place.
Angela, you’re overreacting. What’s going on?
“What’s going on”? What’s wrong with you, Jesi?
You’re making a big joke out of all this, but I’m not laughing.
Wanna know the truth?
I’m a teacher’s aide at a kindergarten.
The kids hate me.
And it’s obvious that I’m about to be fired.
My boyfriend and I live at his grandma’s house,
and now he wants us to have children.
And I don’t think I love him anymore, but I can’t bring myself to tell him.
And I have nowhere else to go.
Basically, my life sucks.
But I swear I prefer it to the horrible feeling this is causing us.
Those sneakers are pretty cute, huh?
I can’t believe how irritating you are.
Okay, okay. Wait.
I know the situation sucks, okay?
But the money is most likely dirty.
Look, Angela, I went to sleep last night for the first time,
thinking my life could be better.
Fantastic, even.
It’s so much money though.
I know we’re gonna end up getting in trouble.
Well, why don’t we enjoy it, then?
[whimsical music playing]
[sighs]
THURSDAY
[whimsical music continues]
[oil sizzling]
[children laughing, screaming]
OK. BUT LET’S SET SOME RULES.
[phone chimes]
ANGELA WE ONLY TAKE WHAT WE NEED.
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BUY?
[phone chimes]
JÉSICA SHOES, A NEW PHONE, A JACKET, A HOUSE.
OKAY. CHILL OUT. LET’S TAKE IT SLOW.
SEE YOU THERE AT 5.
[man] Jésica, the fries. What’s happening?
Coming!
[man] Put them on. Hurry up!
[children, laughing, screaming]
[rhythmic pop music playing]
Hey.
We won’t buy that much, and we won’t draw attention to ourselves.
Agreed?
Okay.
[rhythmic pop music continues]
What is this?
We said only what we needed, remember?
This is only what I need.
Okay, do you remember what we said about not drawing attention?
Yeah, sorry. That’s the part I forgot.
What are you gonna tell them when you get home?
I could go home riding an elephant,
and they wouldn’t notice anything was different.
Besides, I’m gonna leave all this in the apartment. What’s the problem?
Your bags are pathetic.
They’re not pathetic. They’re all I needed.
Mm. They’re pathetic.
They’re not pathetic.
[inaudible]
[rhythmic pop music continues]
[inaudible]
[rhythmic pop music continues]
Hey.
No, no, no. Come on. Let’s go. You’ve got enough. It’s time to leave now.
[rhythmic pop music continues]
[Severino] Come on, boys.
[dog snarls, barks]
[Severino] Come here.
Come, come, come. Come, come.
That’s it.
[elevator dings]
[automated voice] Elevator going up.
[soothing elevator music playing]
Hi there.
Hi.
[dogs snarling]
No.
I said no.
[dog whimpers]
[dog snarling]
The phone I bought cost 12 weeks of pay.
[whispers] What’s the matter?
Huh?
[dog snarls]
[dog snarls]
What?
[sneezes, barks]
So what if our neighbor is a journalist? I don’t get it.
[Angela] He’s not just a journalist.
He’s Daniel Severino, the one who tells all.
So?
What if it’s not a coincidence?
What?
What if someone tipped him off, and the guy is here for the money?
Do you wanna be exposed on TV?
Depends on the show.
Come on, Jésica.
Why would we be exposed on TV?
Because you and I are not being very discreet about our situation.
We have to keep a lower profile.
Do you understand what I’m saying?
Hey! Are you listening?
Yes, totally.
Should we order sushi?
[sighs]
[Jésica, Angela laughing]
[Angela] Oh, it’s so…
[both continue laughing]
[Jésica] It’s true.
[Angela] Oh my God.
Okay.
[Angela sighs]
[sighs] We have to go.
What time do you go to work tomorrow?
[chuckles] At wine o’clock.
[both laugh]
No, no, no!
Mm.
No!
No more of that. No more of that.
Oh, I can’t get up.
Oh, me neither. Should we stay here?
That’s impossible.
Why is that?
Because…
That’s my jacket!
Hmm? No, yours is in that bag over there.
You bought the same jacket as me?
It’s not the same. It’s got this little thing here on the…
It’s just different.
I can’t believe this.
There were two million jackets in that place,
and you buy the exact same one that I did?
It’s not that exact jacket, you know.
I am completely incensed at your behavior!
[both laughing]
[Jésica] You crack me up.
[both laughing]
Don’t laugh.
I have to teach tomorrow.
[sentimental music playing]
What if you don’t go,
and we say to hell with it all, and we stay here tonight
and go buy more clothes tomorrow?
You can’t tell me this isn’t a great life.
This isn’t our life though.
Whose is it, then?
I don’t know.
So then, it’s ours.
You bought the same jacket as me.
It made me do it.
[both laugh]
[doorbell rings]
[Jésica] Oh!
[both laugh]
[doorbell rings]
Sh, sh, sh!
[Angela] Who is that?
How would I know?
[doorbell rings]
[suspenseful music playing]
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?
[Severino] I’m from the 23rd floor.
It’s Daniel Severino.
We’re screwed.
Angela.
Jesi, what are you doing?
Hey!
Don’t open it. Don’t open it.
I told you we needed to be more careful. Didn’t I tell you that?
Are you crazy? How is this my fault?
Who cares? What do we do?
Give him money.
What?
You could bribe him! We have cash!
I can’t just bribe someone. I don’t know how to do it.
Well, just dive in. It might be genetic.
Come on, Jésica!
[doorbell rings]
Coming!
Just tell him no comment, that he has to talk to our lawyer.
Do you have a lawyer?
No. You?
Just keep quiet.
Good evening.
How are you?
Are you relatives of Ernesto?
Of whom?
Of Ernesto Di Pace.
Ernesto Di Pace.
Possibly.
We haven’t seen him in a long time. We don’t know what he’s been involved in.
Let’s just say we’re family.
My deepest condolences.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The last time I saw him, he told me he had an item for me.
An item?
An item.
An item.
Is there an item here with my name on it, perchance?
Did you see his name?
Mm, no.
Nothing here.
Nothing.
How strange.
[gulps]
[Severino] Hmm.
Well, if you do happen to find my item,
could you let me know? I’d appreciate it.
[Angela] Hmm.
[Severino] Bye.
[Angela] Bye.
Thank you.
[Jésica] Bye.
FRIDAY
[whimsical music playing]
Jésica, Tincho wants you.
Huh? Me?
Mm. What did I do now?
Tincho, you called me?
Huh?
Did you call me?
Oh, yeah.
You’re not asking people if they want the normal or the basic combo.
You have to ask them that.
What do I need to ask?
If they want the normal combo or the basic. That’s all.
Okay.
Is there a difference?
Yeah.
The normal has bacon and extra cheese.
It’s more expensive.
Perfect.
Can I ask it the other way instead? If they want basic or normal?
No. Normal or basic. Hmm?
If I say it that way, they’ll choose normal,
and it’s more expensive.
That’s the idea, Jésica. Hmm?
[pensive music playing]
[employee] Seventy-three.
Can I help you?
Um…
A Norte burger combo, please.
[employee] Ninety-four.
Normal or basic?
Normal, right?
That’ll be thirty-three hundred.
[register beeping]
[customer] That’s all that I have.
[Jésica, in Spanish] ♪ Normal or basic is wrong ♪
♪ Normal or ba… ♪
[customer 1] Hello.
[music stops]
I ordered two combos. Didn’t you hear?
[customer 2] I want fries with that and extra ketchup.
[stirring music playing]
See you later.
[employee 3] Where are you going?
I’m outta here.
[woman] Did you make this castle?
[Angela] Of course. Yes.
We did everything together.
He took me to the beach, covered my body with sunscreen.
I was his treasure.
It’s a lovely picture.
They’re all yours, Angelita.
Goodbye, kids! I’ll see you tomorrow!
[children] See you tomorrow, Miss Silvina!
[boy] See you tomorrow!
[children screaming]
Children!
[phone ringing]
What’s up? I’m in class.
I swear, I’m trying to be the best that I possibly can, okay?
I try to be a better person every day,
but everybody else just keeps stealing from each other!
I don’t know what you’re talking about. Calm down.
We are the only two idiots in the world who find a huge pile of money
and don’t take it!
We didn’t rob anyone.
The money was just there!
The Mafia.
Huh? What Mafia?
The old guy.
The mayor who was at Dad’s funeral is here at the kindergarten.
Why?
I don’t know. I’ll call you later.
No, Angela.
[children screaming]
Listen, you guys.
No, it’s time to be quiet now.
And get in your seats because I have to…
Angelita, there’s someone here to see you.
[Angela] Yeah.
Yeah.
May I come in?
[uneasy music playing]
Good morning, children.
[children] Good morning.
Hello there, dear. How are you?
Do you remember me?
[Angela] Yes, yes.
Chichi.
Omar Chichi.
Yes, uh…
Can I help you with something?
[Chichi] I need to go to your father’s apartment.
To his apartment? How come?
I need to collect an item from there.
An item?
An item.
[boy] An item.
An item?
[Chichi] An item
[mouths]
For the campaign. Don’t worry about it.
The campaign.
[Chichi] If you have the keys to the apartment,
I can go there myself right now.
No. I only have the upstairs key. Jésica has the other one.
Oh, that’s a real problem. What are we gonna do?
Um, will you both be over there sometime soon?
[tense music playing]
Tonight, yes.
Emilio, what time does my meeting with that buffoon end?
[whispering indistinctly]
[Chichi] I’ll be by tonight.
We’ll see you there.
Okay.
Mm.
That’s all.
Mm.
[Chichi] Take good care of yourself.
Mm.
[Chichi] Bye, kids.
[children] Bye! See you later!
[Angela] It wasn’t his money.
It was for the campaign. Dad wasn’t corrupt.
He was just holding it for him, you know?
Okay, so what now?
I don’t know. They’re gonna come by and get it.
Tonight?
Yes, tonight. I told you that.
Like, when?
I don’t know. In a little while.
[Jésica sighs]
That seems totally unfair to me.
Well, I told you it wasn’t gonna last.
So what if we kept a little?
We’re not keeping any.
We can’t screw around with these guys.
Plus, look at all the things we bought.
Let’s see what happens with the apartment. Maybe we can sell it.
Okay. I guess you’re right.
Okay. Can we clean up before they get here?
Mm.
[suspenseful music playing]
[phone chimes]
[sighs]
MARCELO WHERE ARE YOU, PIRU?
[Angela] We should talk to Inesita
to see if she has more…
Jésica?
BLAME ME
Fucking asshole.
[tablet beeps]
[stirring music playing]
[Angela] Hey.
First, you’re wearing my jacket.
And second, what the hell do you think you’re doing?
You can’t just go and steal money from these guys.
I’m serious about that.
The money isn’t ours. Don’t you get that?
Then whose is it?
The campaign’s. I told you that.
So they’ll put up fewer posters. What do you care?
This is gonna change everything for me, Angela.
They’ll come looking for you at your house.
[Jésica] Let them! I’m not gonna go back home.
Where are you going, then?
I don’t know. Anywhere.
There’s a travel agent three blocks away. I’ll go over there.
Buy a ticket to, um, Machu Picchu or something.
Or I’ll take a cab. I’ll take a cab to Machu Picchu.
Jésica, you’re not making sense. Don’t you see?
I’ve got nothing here, Angela. How about you?
How about you?
[phone chimes]
[Marcelo] What’s up, Piru?
Listen, I’m working late tonight.
Leave the lights on. I can’t see a thing when I get home.
I can’t leave here.
I have a life.
Okay, whatever. I’ve gotta get going.
[suitcase wheels rattling]
[sighs]
Stop. Sit down. Sit!
I told you no, Angela! What?
This is important. Seriously.
If you’re gonna steal that money…
Sh!
…we have to be smart about it.
Are you coming with me?
Don’t change the subject, okay? Focus on what I’m telling you.
You’ve gotta cover your tracks.
They can follow your cell phone. You have to get rid of it.
No way. I’d rather get caught.
You really have to think, Jésica.
Are you coming with me?
No!
Fine.
I don’t know. I don’t know.
[Jésica sighs]
[Angela] Tell me a secret.
Huh?
[Angela] Tell me a deep, dark secret.
I don’t know, like…
Did you ever kill anyone?
No.
How about you?
No.
Any trouble with the law?
No.
Well…
Besides this.
[Jésica] No.
Music? What music do you like?
Why are you asking me this?
Because we don’t know each other, okay?
Well, you tell me a secret.
I don’t have any secrets.
Me neither.
[sighs] I don’t wanna be a mother.
I don’t like kids.
Which kids?
Any kids. I just don’t like them.
They get on my nerves. I’d be a horrible mother.
But you teach kindergarten.
Yes.
So why…
I don’t know why.
Piru is your nickname, huh?
[Angela] Hmm?
Why does your boyfriend call you that?
Because when I was 13,
I got really depressed
and set some fires, so Piru is short for pyromaniac.
Hmm. I see.
And how are you doing with that?
Better.
All right. Now it’s your turn. Tell me.
I don’t know.
Come on, Jésica. I bared my soul to you.
Nobody else knows I don’t like kids. Not even my boyfriend.
What do you want me to tell you?
I don’t know. Tell me a deep, dark secret.
One that tells me who you are.
Maybe you should’ve accepted my Facebook request.
You’re so hung up on that, Jésica!
I am.
[tense music playing]
What’s wrong?
[Angela] We have to go.
Let’s get out of here. They’re watching us.
[Jésica] Who is?
Those guys over there.
What are they doing?
They won’t stop looking at us.
They’re Chichi’s guys.
No, they’re not Chichi’s guys.
You don’t get it, do you?
By now, they’ve probably realized that you took the money.
And these people are dangerous. They have connections.
They know police officers, journalists, judges, roller skaters…
And I just can’t.
I can’t do this.
I’m sorry.
It’s too much. This isn’t for me.
[somber music playing]
I’m gonna go back to my house and relax.
I’ll go to work, have a baby…
That’s not so bad, is it?
[dogs snarling]
[tense music playing]
Good evening.
We’d love to chat, but we’re in a hurry at the moment.
[dog barks]
God damn it.
[stirring music playing]
[music fades]
Or we could buy a car.
[salesman] Good evening, ladies.
Hi there.
[salesman] How are you? Can I help you?
Yes, we wanna buy a car, please.
Uh…
We only carry luxury models.
Yes. We want a luxury model, yeah?
Yes, yes.
Okay.
Which one do you like?
That one.
[laughs]
It’s beautiful.
[dogs barking]
[tense music playing]
[Jésica] What are those two doing together?
[Angela] I don’t know. They’re obviously looking for us.
[wistful music playing]
Have you made your decision?
Could we have a few more minutes, sir?
Why not come back tomorrow after you’ve had a chance to sleep on it?
I don’t wanna rush you, but it’s almost closing time.
We’ll take it.
Ah. [chuckles] Wonderful, that’s great.
How would you like to pay?
So I can invoice you.
In euros.
Ah! Ah, ah, ah. Euros.
[pensive music playing]
Well, I have to check, but I don’t think it’ll be a problem.
Perfect.
[Angela] Why did you say euros? Are you crazy? What are you saying?
[distant sirens wailing]
He turned us in.
I knew it! That asshole turned us in. Let’s get out of here.
[sirens continue wailing]
[suspenseful music playing]
[sirens continue wailing]
Well?
I don’t know. They’re still following us.
Okay, go!
Run!
[Angela] Wait! Jésica!
God! What the hell do they want with us?
No, I got it. I got it. Let’s go.
[sirens continue wailing]
I knew we would end up in trouble. Didn’t I tell you?
[sirens stop]
It stopped.
[Jésica sighs]
If I have a life, why am I doing this?
I’ve got two lives.
What?
I’m a singer.
Liar.
[laughs]
I sing.
But where?
In my head.
What do you mean in your head?
I do it in my head.
I’m too embarrassed to sing out loud, so I sing in my head.
It’s like a kind of… imaginary life.
I don’t get it. Are you telling me the truth?
Of course. At least, it’s my truth.
I’ve been doing it since I was little, and it can be confusing sometimes.
There’s times when I’m not sure which life I’m actually living.
You wanted a deep, dark secret, so there you go.
It’s worse to be a kindergarten teacher who doesn’t like kids.
[both laugh]
I’m getting the hell out of here. You wanna come?
[Marcelo] What are you doing, Piru?
Marcelo?
Where are you?
Piru. Behind you, Piru. Right behind you.
What’s going on?
Press the button so I can hear you.
Hi, Marcelo.
I left you some messages.
I’m working late tonight.
They assigned me some buildings here in Puerto Madero.
Be careful. This area is full of delinquents.
What are you doing here?
It’s a long story.
Wait. I’m watching another building.
[pensive music playing]
Okay. What time will you be home?
Hold on.
I’m not coming back to the house.
What? Why?
Hold on.
Because I’m the delinquent.
Piru.
I don’t understand.
Piru?
Are you there?
[Angela] Let’s go.
Are you scared?
Yes. You?
Of course, but it’ll all be all right.
It’ll be all right.
Hey.
Let’s take a taxi to the station and go from there.
It’s the quickest way. Don’t you think?
Yeah.
What’s this?
I told you that was my jacket. Give me that.
It was in Dad’s drawer.
A vacation when I was little.
Why do you have it?
Because I like it, and I wanna have it.
Hmm.
Why aren’t there any taxis?
[Jésica] Throw it away.
[Angela] What?
Yeah. Tear it up or something.
Why would I do that?
I wanna keep it. It’s my memory.
But that’s not really our Dad.
Our Dad was a crook, okay? A… a briber.
[Angela] That money wasn’t his. You don’t wanna understand, do you?
It’s not about the money, Angela. He was always an asshole.
I thought you don’t remember Dad.
No.
The only thing I know is that I only have his last name
because my Mom sued the guy.
And then he disappeared.
He broke her. He broke me.
And he broke you, but you don’t wanna believe it.
He didn’t break me at all.
No, you just started burning things because you were bored.
You’re gonna end up alone, Jesi.
I’ve gotten used to it.
[Angela] Then I’ll make it easy for you.
If you’re expecting me to be your accomplice in this…
I don’t need an accomplice!
What the hell do you want, then?
[scoffs]
[somber music playing]
What are you doing?
[Jésica] What does it look like I’m doing?
You have a serious problem, you know?
Yeah? At least I know when I’m lying to myself.
[scoffs] I can’t believe it.
Me neither.

You’ve been in hiding. You’re so difficult, huh?

[Osterfil] So scary. Law and order together.
Are these battery-powered?
How are you?
These are my children.
Good.
[Osterfil] What do you say, Severino?
[Severino] I have breaking news.
Well, wanna get a coffee?
You’re paying.
Of course, as usual.
[Osterfil] Let’s go.
Come on, kids.
I had to take care of something. It’s underway. We’re close.
[Osterfil] The clock is ticking. This needs to be resolved quickly.
[Barzenac] We got it.
You know when reporters start talking.

Good evening, señorita. How can we help you tonight?
Good evening.
Uh, I’m looking for someone you have here.
Name?
Di Pace. Jésica Di Pace.
Di Pace, all one word?
Or Di space Pace?
Di Pace.
I’ll check, okay?
Di Pace is that delinquent they just brought in.
Are you her lawyer?
No, I just wanna talk to her a minute.
[officer 2] Impossible. She’s in isolation.
Why? What’d she do?
Trafficking and smuggling currency.
It’s a very serious offense.
Very serious.
She’s gonna spend the night here. She’s in deep shit. For you.
Thank you.
[snoring continues]
Can I help you with something else, miss?
Yes.
Yes. Um…
Mm, Fernández, right?
At your service.
Yes.
Fernández,
uh, is there any possibility,
just between the two of us,
maybe we could reach a kind of mutually beneficial agreement?
I get off in two hours.
There’s a hotel near here. How about that, huh?
No!
Oh, no?
[Angela] No, I didn’t mean that at all.
[yawns]
What’s going on, Fernández? Huh?
Nothing!
Nothing.
Nothing’s going on. I was just leaving.
Nothing. No big deal.
[Angela] But I was just, uh, telling Fernández here
that it occurred to me that,
um, maybe the answer is no.
And if it is, that’s fine by me.
I, uh… I’ll be on my way.
But… maybe I’m able to help you, and you could help me.
I have something
that you might find beneficial.
‘Cause what I’m proposing is a kind of exchange.
To make sure no one has a bad taste in their mouth,
I brought something to sweeten the deal.
So you’re selling food?
Oh, I see. You sell food?
What was that? You have empanadas?
Oh, empanadas, of course.
Then I’d like two with meat and two vegetable, okay?
Do you have any with humita?
Three ham and cheese.
Let’s get some for Montenegro. He’ll be pissed off if we don’t.
He can really put it away.
He eats meat.
He eats meat? Okay. Got it.
Yes.

[announcer over PA] Attention all workers.
Attention all workers.
Day shift starting in T-minus 15 minutes.
Farmers to report to mess hall immediately.
If you are experiencing any symptoms, such as fever, cough, vomiting, or difficulty breathing, proceed to the medical bay for examination.
[thunder rumbles]
[rain pattering]
The safety and well-being of our colony is Weyland-Yutani’s top priority.
Attention all workers…
[man] Did you hear about the claustrophobic astronaut?
He needed space.
[woman] I’m begging you, you got to stop.
I just spent my full share on a belt that won’t fit.
Huge waist.
See that cornbread.
[sputters] Maybe it’s ’cause I’m on this seafood diet.
I see food, I eat it.
That’s so bad.
You always laughed at that one.
Yeah, when I was 12.
[device ringing]
I’m sure it’s Mr. Finch.
We owe him three months today.
He’ll call again.




Well, maybe we won’t be here when he does.

[woman] Andy. Stay close to me.
[revolutionist over speakers] Wake up. Wake up now.
We’re all Weyland-Yutani slaves.
The company pays us with food and shelter and takes our lives in exchange.
Don’t believe their lies.
They own you!
[woman] Andy, Andy. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, Andy. Come on. Come on.
What did I do?
It’s a scam.
The ball is never under the cup that you pick.
It’s a trick.
But how am I gonna get the money?
Money for what?
To pay for the horse when we get to Yvaga.
You’re gonna get a horse?
I wanna call it Raindy.
Do you get it?
Raindy.
No, I like it.
Yeah, it’s good.
Okay, so you just wait over there.
Okay, I might be a minute.




Stay out of trouble, all right?
[announcer over PA] All employees will be seen.
[Andy] Good luck.
[announcer over PA] Line up in an orderly fashion.
[officer over PA] Next.
Full name and occupation, please.
Marie Raines Carradine, ma’am. Farming.
It’s about my travel papers.
I met my quota, and I should be free to go now.
Right?
[officer] Go where?
Yvaga.
It’s an independent system, but it’s fully terraformed.
You can actually see the sun out there.
Where are your parents?
Uh, they died three cycles ago.
Lung disease, from the mines.
It’s just me and my brother now.
[revolutionist over speakers] They sell us hope to keep us slaves.
They sell us hope to keep us slaves. Wake up now.
[indistinct chatter]
[laughter]
[officer] I’m sorry, but you’re not eligible for contract release yet.
Due to a shortage of workers, you’re being transferred to the mines.
Wait, what?




No, no, no, I reached the required hours.
You have to let me go.
Unfortunately, quotas have been raised to 24,000 hours, so you’ll be released from contract in another five to six years.
Thank you, and remember the company is really grateful for your ongoing service.

Hey, stop!
Get off him! You bastards!
[whimpering]

Oh, shit, you’re bleeding.
Okay.

I shouldn’t have left you alone.

[Tyler over comms] Hi, Rain.
Look, I’m sorry. I know I’ve been calling you all day, but, look, something’s come up, and I think you should know about it.
So, come by the trailers and bring Andy.
[machinery thudding and clanking]
[indistinct conversation]
Hey.
[man] Oh, for…
[automated voice over gaming console] Game over, man.
Sup, Rain? Long time no see.
I told you she’d show up.
You owe me five bucks.
[man 2] Andy!
[door opens, whirring]
Why’d the blind miner fall down the well?
Why?
‘Cause he couldn’t see that well.
Please don’t encourage him.
All right, go inside. I’ll be there in a second.
Kay.
Rain.
Hi.
Hi!
Hi.
[Kay] I missed you.
And I know my brother missed you, too.
I’m really glad you came.
[Rain] I heard about your dad.
I’m really sorry.




Well, between the hailstorms and the new diseases every cycle…
Yeah, everybody’s dying, right?
So, should we show her?
Show me what?
[system beeps]
Okay, so, last night, we’re loading up the last Tesotek, we’re about 200 miles above the ground, and then all of a sudden…
[imitates rapid beeping]
The hauler picks up this beacon.
So Navarro tracks it, and it turns out there’s this big Wey-Yu ship drifting right above our heads.
Drifting?
Decommissioned. Abandoned.
Some old relic. It’s probably damaged or obsolete.
Like that guy over there.
[Navarro] Bjorn.
Okay, just tell her.
Why are we all sitting around here waiting for travel permits that the company are never gonna give to us?
‘Cause that hauler has enough power in it to get us to Yvaga.
Because it takes nine years to get to Yvaga and you can’t make that trip without cryo-sleep.
Decommissioned ships still carry tons of functional equipment.
And the hyperlink shows that ship still has a few pods left.
[chuckles in disbelief]
You want to break into a Weyland-Yutani ship and steal highly regulated equipment?
Before someone else does.
[laughs]
You guys are insane.
Well, of course we are.
[man] No. No, we’re not.
This is…
[Navarro] That’s what I said.
[Kay] Are you gonna help us?
[hesitates] Sorry, what do you need me for?
Andy.
We need to use Andy.
Andy?
[Bjorn] Mm-hmm.
[man] He’s a Weyland-Yutani synthetic. He speaks Mother.
He can access a terminal on the ship
to get us in and out without a fuss.
It’s the only way to get in.
Okay, but what if we get caught?
It’ll ruin our chances of ever getting a travel permit.
Right, Rain’s not comin’.
Uh, how about you let us take Andy then?
I’m not sending my brother up there alone.
He’s not your brother though, is he?
Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
It’s true, though, isn’t it?
He’s not your brother. It’s just Wey-Yu damaged goods
that your dad found in the trash.
And that’s all he is, Rain. So just wake up.




Let’s go.
[Andy] Rain?
[Bjorn] What?
I didn’t say anything.
[man] Rain, wait.
I’m sorry. Listen, I know my cousin
can be a dick sometimes, all right?
But he is right about something.
You need to wake up.
Because this company,
they’re not gonna give us anything.
You know that as well as I do. We have to take it.
[♪♪ somber music playing]
Rain, I just…
I don’t want to end up like our parents.
Do you?
[bird chirping]
Is it as easy as you’re making it sound, this plan of yours?
You won’t even have to get out of the Corbelan.
That much I can promise you, okay?
Come on. What do you say?
[engines powering up]
[thunder rumbles]
[man] Bjorn, hurry up, let’s go.
All right, I’m starting her up. Batteries on.
[Bjorn] Lovely.
[system powering up]
[Navarro] Could I get hydro, please?
Comm panel.
Ground spoilers.
[man] They are armed.
[Bjorn] First time in space, huh?
[Rain] Yeah.
[Bjorn] You too? Boop!
[Navarro] Fuel pump.
[man] On.
[Bjorn] Two space virgins coming through.
[man] Right, take a good look outside the window
’cause the way I see it, we’re never coming back.
[engines roaring]
[praying in Mandarin]
[in English] You good?
I’m good.
Yeah. It’s gonna be all right.
[engines powering up]
Are you sure this is a good idea now?
[Bjorn] Sure, Dad.
Here comes the crush.
[Corbelan rumbling]
[all laughing]
[coughing]
[Bjorn] That’s how it’s done, bitch.
[Corbelan rumbling and creaking]
[Rain exhales deeply]

Is that…
Yeah.
That is our sun.
[♪♪ captivating music playing]
[Kay] They say Yvaga has the most incredible sunsets.
I’ve seen them.
In my dreams. [chuckles softly]
[Andy] I can’t wait to see them with you.
[Rain] Yeah.
[Bjorn] You know, I heard that cryo-sleep just makes years
feel like one night of heavy drinkin’ apparently.
So when we wake up in Yvaga tomorrow,
we’ll wake up with a hangover.
[sighs deeply]
There she is.
That’s not a ship.
No.
[Bjorn over comms] Fuck, that’s big. What is that?
[man] Decommissioned outpost? I don’t know.
Probably got dragged into our orbit.
Okay, Navarro, let’s get closer, please.
[Navarro] Okay. I’m gonna match its roll.
[♪♪ suspenseful music playing]
[automated voice] Hazard proximity alert.
[Rain] What’s wrong?
It’s just the belt’s a bit closer than I thought.
[Navarro] How long?
It’s 36 hours, give or take.
Till what?
Before the station crashes against the rings.
[Bjorn] Sorry, what?
What did you just say? That doesn’t sound very good.
[man] 36 hours.
We should be in and out in 30 minutes.
Yeah?
[Rain] Andy.
[Bjorn] Yeah, tops.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
I have just one directive.
To do what’s best for Rain.
Your dad wrote it.
Yeah.
That and too many dad jokes.
I’m happy…
to help.
[sighs]
Be careful out there.
[metal straining]
[man] Okay, hurry up. We’re docking in two minutes.
Put that on.
[Bjorn] Now, why I gotta put this on for?
[man] So you don’t freeze your balls off.
[Bjorn] Mate, you gotta stop obsessing
about my balls, man. It’s unhealthy.
[man] Keep talking and I’ll chop ’em off.
[Bjorn] Aw, you really want ’em for yourself, don’t you?
Hey, you want me to show you my balls or something?
[man] Oh, shut up a minute.
Gloves, here, take these.
[Bjorn] Hey! No. Stop touching shit.
Come over here.
[man] Bjorn, leave him alone,
for fuck’s sake.
Andy, take no notice.
[Bjorn] All right, okay, won’t be my fault
when he breaks somethin’.
[button beeps]
[Navarro] There’s a synth hatch
right ahead. I’m gonna dock.
[man over comms] Copy that. Just bring us in slow.
[loud thud]
[metal groaning]
[device beeping]
[scanner whirring]
[man] Oh, fuck me, it’s cold in there.
What’s that?
[man over comms] It’s a temp-scanner.
It’s gonna lead us to the pods.
[lever cranking]
[man] Okay, compression is good enough.
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.
Andy…
[over comms] …you’re up.
It’s your time to shine.
[chimes]
[door opens]
[chuckles] Yes! Andy!
Beautiful work.
Okay.
[laughs]
[Bjorn] Congrats. You’re not a virgin anymore.
[man] All right.
[air blowing]
[man] Okay, let’s go.
[Bjorn grunting]
[Bjorn] Fuck.
[Tyler] Guys, it looks like we’re in zero-g.
[Bjorn] Yeah, I can feel it in my stomach.
[machinery whirring]
[gravity generators warbling]
Wait, what’s that?
Gravity generators.
When offline, they still purge themselves every few minutes.
[Tyler] Prevents the place from blowing up.
[gravity generators warbling]
[Bjorn] Oh, fuck me, there goes my stomach again.
[Tyler] Okay, straight ahead.
[♪♪ suspenseful music playing]
[Tyler] According to the scanner,
the pods should be in here.
[panting] Jesus.
Andy, you good?
[Andy] Yeah.
[Tyler] All right, great news. I’ve got eyes on the pods.
[gravity generators pulsing]
Fuck!
[Bjorn grunts]
[Tyler] Bjorn, you okay?
[Bjorn] Fuck! [groans]
I think I fractured my asshole.
[gravity generators warbling]
Fuckin’ hell. Don’t fuck with this gravity purge, man.
[chimes]
[system beeping]
[Tyler] Thank God, there’s still
some power left in this relic.
[machinery powering up]
[Tyler] Okay, watch out. Gravity’s coming back.
[Bjorn grunts] Fuckin’ hell.
[pods hissing]
[Tyler] All right, here we go.
Let’s see what we got.
Okay.
Shit.
What’s the problem?
Pods don’t have enough fuel.
What do you mean?
[Tyler] They’re loaded up for three years in stasis.
[Bjorn] Yeah, but it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga, mate.
[Tyler] Yeah, I know, I know. I’m aware of that.
[Bjorn] Fuckin’ hell.
I knew it. I fuckin’ knew it.
I knew it.
[Tyler] Just relax.
Maybe you guys should just come back.
[Tyler] No, no, we’re not givin’ up now.
[Bjorn] Yvaga’s the nearest system.
So what are we supposed to do now? Huh?
What are we gonna do?
[Tyler] Shut up.
Okay, strong reading. Must be a cryo depot nearby.
We should find more fuel there.
Navarro, I’m ejecting the EEV.
Come on, Andy.
You guys pick it up while we get the cryo-fuel.
[Tyler] Hold.
Yeah, 400 yards away, dead ahead.
What’s with the military shit?
What?
[Bjorn] All that military shit.
Well, it’s effective.
Is it? [snickers]
And cool.
It’s not very cool.
You just look like a twat.
[Andy] I’m sorry.
[Tyler] All right, chill.
Let’s keep it movin’.
[Bjorn] If you do that again, I’ll fuck you up.
[Rain] Bjorn, back off!
[Bjorn] You understand?
Just as long as he stays out of my way.
Why is he being such a dick to him?
Because of what happened to his mom.
What do you mean?
[Navarro] Last cycle,
there was a gas leak in the mines,
so a synthetic made the call to seal them
with Bjorn’s mom still trapped inside.
What?
Synthetics can’t harm humans.
It sacrificed three miners to save a dozen.
That, they can do.
That’s terrible.
[engine revving]
[♪♪ intriguing music playing]
I got you, I got you.
Come on, come on, come on.
Easy, easy.
Good job.
[Kay retches]
[vomiting]
[Rain] Kay!
Kay! Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
I’m right here. I’m right here. You’re okay.
[Kay breathing heavily]
[Navarro] I’m gonna go check on the pods.
[hatch door whirring]
[Kay] No, no. Don’t worry.
I’m not sick.
[Rain] What’s wrong, then?
[Kay] Nothing is.
Oh, girl.
Who’s the father?
Some asshole.
Just don’t tell my brother, okay?
He has enough things to worry about.
No. I won’t say anything.
I’m just happy this baby will get to see the sun.
[♪♪ stirring music playing]
[scanner whirring]
[Tyler] I think we’re almost there.
Okay, Navarro.
Airlock 5-B, that’s our way out
once we find this cryo-fuel.
[Navarro] On my way.
[automated voice over PA] Welcome to the
Renaissance Space Station,
the center of Weyland-Yutani Research and Development.
The station is divided into two halves,
Romulus and Remus,
each dedicated to our quest to improve
mankind’s role in outer space.
This place gives me the creeps.
Did you hear about the miner who lost his left side?
He’s all right now.
Do you get it? He’s all right.
[Bjorn] Can you turn yourself off, please?
You said you were nervous
and I was trying to make sure you were…
Jesus! You know, I can’t wait to get in them pods
and never see you again, you know that?
[Andy] You’ll see me in Yvaga.
[Bjorn] No, you’re not going to Yvaga.
[Tyler] Bjorn, stop!
I’m not?
Well done.
Oh, she didn’t tell you?
Yeah, yeah, it’s a non-Weyland-Yutani system,
so no fake people allowed.
I prefer the term “artificial person” myself.
Andy, look.
[over comms] Rain could end up in prison
if she takes you with her.
And if you guys stay in Jackson,
it’s just a matter of time
before you get decommissioned again by the company.
You understand?
I need you on the ship to guard the pods.
But once we get there…
[Bjorn] Decommish.
Lights out for good.
[object clatters]
You done?
[Bjorn] Just tellin’ the truth.
That’s okay.
If it’s what’s best for Rain, it’s what’s best for me.
You’re a good guy, Andy.
We’re all gonna miss you.
[Navarro] So he didn’t know?
I just did not have the heart to tell him.
[Navarro] You shouldn’t feel bad.
[softly] Shit.
[Navarro] You’re not gonna throw
your whole life away for Andy’s sake.
[sighs]
He doesn’t care. It doesn’t matter to him.
Okay? He’s not…
you know, real.
[♪♪ solemn music playing]
[♪♪ ominous music builds]
[Tyler] The signal’s coming from in here.
[Rain] Thought you said this place was decommissioned.
[Tyler] Yeah.
[Rain] Doesn’t look decommissioned to me.
[Tyler] No, it doesn’t.
But it’s definitely deserted.
[Taser powering up]
Hey, Andy, look at this.
I could probably fry a synthetic with one of these…
if I just amp up the juices.
[crackling]
Hey, you know, I might take this with me, actually.
[Tyler] All right, enough.
Just in case you have any fucking funny ideas.
[gasping] It’s a joke. I was joking.
What the fuck?
Watch out.
[Tyler] Shit.
It’s only a synthetic.
[chuckles nervously]
Fuck. [exhales]
I thought it was a real person there for a second.
[Navarro] What happened in there?
[Tyler] Don’t know. A chemical spill, maybe.
The fuel must be in that room.
Let’s grab it and get the fuck out of here.
[Tyler] All right. Andy?
[lock chiming]
[door creaking]
[Tyler] Bjorn, take the torch please.
[Bjorn] I don’t think there’s any pods in here.
[Tyler] Nah, just cooling equipment.
Uses the same type of fuel, though.
[beeping]
Yes.
[exhales]
[Tyler] Forty-five Ks.
It’s more than enough fuel to get us to Yvaga.
Right. Bjorn, give me a hand with this, please.
[grunts]
[Tyler] Bjorn, pull it out on three, all right?
Ready?
[Bjorn] Uh-huh.
[Tyler] One, two…
three.
[air hissing]
[Bjorn groans] Fuck!
Fuck.
My fingers.
[alarm blares]
I can’t feel my fingers.
It really hurts. Just froze my hands off.
What’s happening?
[Bjorn] Fuck.
[Tyler] Don’t know. It’s some kind of emergency lockdown.
Andy, the door.
Shit, he doesn’t have the clearance.
What does that mean?
[Tyler] Doesn’t have the clearance to open the door.
So you’re trying to tell me that
he can fucking reboot the entire ship,
but can’t open a random fucking door
to a random room?
Well, obviously, that’s no random room.
[Bjorn straining] Come on!
Come on!
[alarm continues blaring]
[Navarro] Hey, don’t worry. We’ll get ’em out of there.
If Andy can’t open those doors,
I doubt we’ll have better luck.
He’s a Weyland-Yutani synthetic
and we’re just trespassing.
[indistinct announcement over PA]
Yeah, so you got any ideas?
[Rain] Not yet.
[Navarro] I think it’s in here.
Bjorn!
Tyler!
They’re in there.
Hey, what are you doing?
If this module is still working,
I can try to transfer its credentials to Andy.
A higher clearance should open that door.
[alarm blaring]
[♪♪ foreboding music playing]
[cryo-fuel hissing]
[squelching]
Shit. It’s stuck.
It’s so hot in here, man.
[♪♪ ominous music playing]
Whoa.
Sick.
Yeah, maybe try not to touch anything in here.
[Navarro] Yeah, okay, Mom.
[yelps]
[synthetic screeching]
Help me! Help!
Oh, no! What do I do?
The module. Take it out!
[both panting]
You okay?
That was fucked up.
Here.
[Rain] Let me see.
Yes, okay.
[Tyler] All right.
Got it.
[Rain] Hey.
Rain.
This is from that synthetic.
Try putting it on Andy’s module.
I’m so sorry.
Let’s just get outta here.
Andy?
All right, let’s see.
Okay.
[Andy gasps]
Fuck.
Rain, did I do something wrong? He’s just frozen up.
[Rain] He’s just rebooting.
It’s gonna take a couple of minutes.
[squeaking]
[squelching]
[Tyler] Here, let me get you something for those fingers.
[water splashes]
The fuck was that?
All right, stay there a second.
[Rain] Tyler?
[Navarro] Hey, what are you guys doing?
[creature chittering]
[gasps] Bjorn?
Stop playing around, man. Just get up.
[Bjorn] I’m not playing around.
There’s something in the water.
[Navarro] What do you mean? What is it?
I don’t know. I don’t know what it is.
There’s something in the fuckin’ water.

Come on! Help me!
No, stop. Stop. Don’t…
No! Navarro!
Those things will get out.
If they come in here… If they come in…
If they come…
[Rain] No!
Fuck. Fuck.

[Tyler] Stay still. Stay still.
[Bjorn] I know! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[Rain] It’s choking her.
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!
It’s choking her!
[Tyler] Shit.
Stop! Bjorn!
Bjorn, stop! For fuck’s sake, stop!
Stop!
What’s it doin’?
Is it fuckin’ killin’ her?
[Andy] I do not believe that’s what the creature is doing.
No.
[Rain] Andy?
Based on the rhythmic dilatation of those bladders,
and its synchronization to her breathing patterns,
I’d surmise it’s feeding her oxygen to keep her alive.
For what purpose, I do not know.
Sorry, who the fuck are you?
I’m an ND-255 Weyland-Yutani synthetic.
Originally built for mining and safety tasks.
You guys call me Andy.
It’s that module.
Yes.
That new module didn’t just upgrade my credentials.
It substantially updated my AI,
and it’s mending my motor systems as we speak.
A most overdue upgrade, I must say.
Shit. I’mma fucking fry this thing.
[Rain] Okay, wait.
Don’t!
Why not?
That amount of current
will violently contract its tail flexors
and will break her neck.
So what, you got a better idea?
What should we fucking do then, huh?
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey.
Andy, do you know how to help her?
I’m afraid my knowledge database
has not really changed.
I do not know what this creature is
or how to remove it safely.
But there’s someone in this room who might.

Mission’s priority. All other priorities rescinded.
Must complete the mission.
I’m sorry…
but your mission has failed.
[synthetic] What? No, I…
Can you tell us what we can do to help her?
You don’t help her. You run.
Get out, however you got in.
[Bjorn] No, no, no. Wait, whoa, whoa.
Nah, we’re not fuckin’ leavin’ her, okay? You understand?
Then have mercy and end her life now.
If not, you all die.
[Bjorn] So what the fuck is he sayin’?
What’s it doing to her?
The parasitoid is implanting
the Plagiarus Praepotens in her.
I beg your pardon?
A seed that will amalgamate with her DNA
and rapidly grow out of her.
What’s gonna grow out of her?
[♪♪ dramatic music playing]
XX121 Xenomorph.
One of our towing ships
first made contact with this specimen two decades ago.
Of the seven crew members
aboard the USS Nostromo, only one survived,
blowing the creature out of the airlock.
We’ve been searching for it ever since.
170 days ago, our search came to an end
and the body of the Xenomorph was brought on board…
presumed dead.
But of course,
lack of oxygen and food is of no true consequence to this
perfect organism.
Yet nothing is truly immortal.
Clearly.
It wreaked havoc over this station,
until what was left of our security forces shot it dead.
Only to trigger its swan song.
Acid for blood?
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.
I sealed the station back up, but it was too late.
[Bjorn] Hey, shut up!
Nobody cares about your fucking ship anymore.
Okay, okay. Okay.
What if we use the cryo-fuel
to freeze the root of the tail?
Maybe if it’s frozen, it won’t choke her.
That could work.

[Rain shushing]
You’re okay. You’re okay.
[synthetic] I wouldn’t be so sure.
What are the odds?
60 to 40 against your friend.
What are the odds on what?
That the creature’s finished its job already.
[weakly] What is he talking about?
[synthetic] Listen to me.
Humans go through too many emotional stages
before accepting the cold,
yet rational
sometimes hardest
path.
You must help them.
You must help them.

[Rain] Andy?
What’s going on?
I’m sorry
but we can’t let her back on the ship.
Oh, yeah? That is a problem.

Andy! Andy!
[electricity crackling]
[Andy] The parasitoids have no eyes.
They track you by sound,
but primarily, by heat signature.
What?
Your body temperature.
[Tyler] Right.
If we raise the temperature in the room
to match our bodies,
would that make us invisible to them?
If we’re quiet enough?
Just one way to find out.
Hey.
This is all my fault.
[Tyler sighs deeply]
Yeah, it is.
Yours, mine, and everyone else’s.
We all decided to do this together.
We’ll get to them.

is now equal to your bodies,
so the creatures should not be able to see you.
But stress, fear, panic will spike your temperature
and you’ll be exposed.

So watch out for those.

[muffled] Kay…
We’re here. We’re here. It’s all right,
it’s all right, it’s all right.
Andy, open the door.
It’s all right.
We’re gonna get you out.
[muffled] Tyler, open the door.
Open the door. Come on.
Oh, my God.
[Tyler] Look at me. Kay, Kay, Kay. Look at me.
[Rain] Andy, open the door.
Kay, look at me. Look at me.
It’s all right. I’m gonna get you out.
Andy, open the door. Stop fucking around.
[Rain] What are you doing?
[Tyler] Don’t look
over there. Andy.
[Kay] Tyler, what’s wrong?
Hey, I need you to open that door right now, okay?
That’s what the creature’s waiting for us to do.
[Kay] Open it, please.
[snarling]
[Tyler] Andy. Andy, open the door.
Listen to me. Listen to me. She’s pregnant.
[Kay] Just, please. Guys, please. Come on.
[Rain] She’s gonna have a baby. Okay?
Do you hear what I’m saying?
[Andy] It takes that door
two seconds to open, another two to fully close.
[Kay] What are you doing? What are you doing?
Come on, what are you doing? Please…
That’s plenty of time for the creature to get in here.
[Kay] Please, please, please open the door.
Why won’t you help me?
[muffled] Listen, listen.
Come on, help me, please.
You have to run right now.
Please, please.
Run. Run.
You’re one of us, man. You’re one of us!
[Rain] Kay, it’s the only way.
Open the fucking door. Andy!
[Rain] You have to
fucking run. All right?
[Tyler] Andy, please!
[Rain] It’s the only way.
[Tyler] Andy!
[Rain] You have to run!
[Kay] Please!
[Tyler] Open the fucking…
[muffled scream]
[Xenomorph screeching]
[Tyler] Kay! Kay!
No, no, no.
Kay!
[Tyler sobbing]
[yells]
[Tyler mumbling] I’ll open it.
She’s all right. She’s moving.
No. It’s all right.
[Rain sobbing]
[Tyler] Andy, open the door, please.
Andy, I need to go and get her.
I’m truly sorry.
There was nothing I could have done to save her.
You could have opened the fucking door! [yells]
We’d all be dead if I had.
We need to move before the creature
finds its way into this room.
[Rain] Andy…
what’s your prime directive?
I’m afraid I have a new directive.
To do what’s best for the company.
[breathing shakily]
I need to remove that module.
I’m afraid that’s not in the best interest of the company.
We need to move.
Now.
How could you do that?
What?
Leave someone behind?
Where are we going?
To finish a task Rook has entrusted upon me.
When completed, he’ll clear the Corbelan
for departure and open the docking bay doors.
You will be free to continue to Yvaga together.
And I’ll return to Jackson.
And stay in Jackson.
That is, assuming we make it out of here alive.
We’re here.
[door levers cranking]
[♪♪ dramatic music playing]
[automated voice] Romulus Beta Lab.
All personnel require A-1 security clearance.
[Rain] What is that?
Probably some fucked up bio-weapon, I’m sure.
[Rook over monitor] Actually, quite the opposite.
Andy, tell them.
Tell them what I told you.
[Andy] Our colonies are dying.
Unbearable temperatures, novel diseases every cycle.
Toxic mine fumes.
It’s all one unforeseen tragedy after the other.
Mankind was never truly suited for space colonization.
They’re simply too fragile.
They’re too weak.
The work of this station aimed to change that.
“The perfect organism.”
That’s how we should refer to human beings.
So, I set this wrong right.
I took its gift for humanity.
Inside the parasitoids I bioengineered
from the Xenomorph’s DNA,
I discovered a unique non-Newtonian fluid.
Life.
In its most primal, unadulterated form.
This microorganism can be the most
destructive pathogen ever observed.
But acetylated and synthesized in our lab,
I’ve turned it into the miracle
Mr. Weyland died searching for.
Prometheus fire.
The divine gift to humanity.
Z-01 contains the genome responsible
for the Xeno’s ability to accelerate
and slow down its metabolism at will.
Its symbiotic capableness easily rewrites
the host’s DNA through its blood.
This is a much needed and well overdue upgrade for humanity.
We simply cannot wait for evolution anymore.
Yeah, can we get out of here now?
My mission is to take this back to the colony
for further development.
Rook is tracking the compound.
When detected inside our ship,
he’ll open the docking bay doors
and set the hauler on autopilot back to the colony.
Wait.
Do you see it?
There.
The fucking thing’s huntin’ us.
[Andy] Right. New plan.
Can you manage yourself with a gun?
Yes, I fucking can.
Right, this is an F44AA pulse rifle.
It’s rotating breech, electronic pulse action.
It’s what the Colonial Marines used.
AA stands for Aiming Assist.
So, right, you put that under your arm.
[rifle clicks]
That’s it. Right, this hand here.
All right. Aim it towards Andy.
Pull the trigger halfway.
Don’t worry, the safety’s on.
[rifle chiming, clicks]
See?
Aiming assistance.
If that thing comes towards you,
you point it in its general direction, you’ll never miss.
Where’d you learn all this?
Uh…
Games and magazines.
You’ve just got one mag. That’s it.
450 rounds.
[Andy] And you mustn’t fire a single one.
Acid for blood. Remember?
We’re on the bottom floor of the station.
Below our feet is the vacuum of space.
You shoot that creature
and it’s a guaranteed instant decompression.
And we all die.
So what’s the point in giving us the guns?
Because the creature may see it as a threat,
and maybe won’t charge at us dead on.
Maybe.
Big maybe.
I found us a way through the conveyor belt.
This way.
Andy.
Are you there?
[rat squeaking]
[automated voice] T-minus 20 minutes to impact event.
[Andy] There’s a lift at the end of this corridor.
It will take us directly to our ship.
[Rain] There’s more of those things.
Yeah, that’s not good.
[Andy] They seem to have been here for quite some time.
[Rain] Andy?
[lever clicks]
[Rain breathing shakily]
[lights switching on]
[gasps]
[softly] Jesus Christ.
[♪♪ sinister music playing]
[Andy] Busy little creatures.
I think we better go back and find another way.
That might be a good idea.
[Rain] Andy, see if you can open this gate.
[heavy breathing in distance]
[Tyler] Stop.
[Rain] What?
[groaning echoing]
Kay!
[Rain] Hey!
Tyler!
Tyler!
[Tyler] Kay!
Kay!
Kay!

[♪♪ eerie music playing]
[Tyler] Kay!
I got her, I got her.
It’s all right. We got you.
She’s alive.
[Tyler and Rain grunting]
[Tyler] Okay, we got you, we got you.
[Rain] Hold on.
[Tyler grunts] Okay.
[Kay groaning weakly]
[Tyler] We’re here, we’re here.
Tyler, she’s losing a lot of blood.
[Andy] Maybe that’s why she hasn’t been implanted yet.
[Tyler] How do you know?
There’s no dead parasitoid by her feet.
Andy, this is on you. So you do something.
Please! Andy!
[Andy] 25% of the human genome is shared with rats.
And it worked on the rat.
[breathing weakly]
[Tyler] Come on, Kay.
[Rain] Don’t.
What choice do I have?
We take her back to the hauler
and we put her in the cryo-pod. Okay?
That will keep her alive long enough to
get her proper treatment back at the colony.
I don’t trust this.
Andy, will she make it?
If we hurry.
[screeching]
[distant screeching]
[rifle powering up]
[♪♪ tense music playing]
[Rain] Go! Go!
[Rain] I see it. I see it.
[Tyler] This is it, this is it.
[Rain] I got her. I got her. I got her.
[Rain] You’re okay. You’re okay.
We’re so close. We’re so close.
[Kay wincing and groaning]
Hey. Hey, you’re okay.
Hey, we’re almost there. We’re almost there.
You see, you’re so close.
You just gotta hang in there.

This goes straight to our ship.
I need you to take this. And get into a cryo-pod.
And autopilot will fly you back to our colony.
Can you do that?
[Kay sniffling]
Yes?
What about you?
I’ll find a way back.

of the company or mine.

[Rook] You’re wasting your time.
Hey. Hey. Please help us.
Open the door.
I’m afraid I must deny your petition.
I just can’t risk compromising the compound.
But know that I’m grateful for the invaluable help
you two have provided to the company.
[grunting]
[Rain] Son of a bitch!

Andy, open it.
[Andy] Here.
[Rain] Open.
It’s not working.

I can’t lie about your chances,
but you have my sympathies.
[Rain gasps]
[Xenomorphs screeching]
[Kay groaning]
[wheezing]
[button beeping]
[Rook] Press it,
so I can take control of your ship and fly you out of here.
[weakly] Who are you?
A friend.
Your companions died so you could live.
Press the button…
and let me honor their sacrifice.
Andy, can you tell me one of your jokes?
Why don’t monsters eat clowns?
[Xenomorphs approaching]
‘Cause they taste funny.
They taste funny.
I don’t understand cloning at all.
That makes two of us.
I read a great book about zero gravity.
I just couldn’t put it down.
Couldn’t put it down.
Rain?
Rain?
Rain, what are you doing?
I’m turning off the gravity generator.
[automated voice] Ten, nine, eight, seven,

Rain, are you sure about this?
Only one way to find out.

I’m glad to see you two made it.
[boosters roaring]
[metal groaning]
[Rain] I got you. Watch your head.
Thank you.
You’re gonna be just fine.
Both of you.
The company couldn’t be prouder of what’s been accomplished here today.
I’ve sent a message back to HQ.
When received in six months, they’ll travel to Jackson’s Star to retrieve the compound from you for further development.
What are you doing?
Change of plans.
Andy, stop her.
Reconnect us now.
No, no, no. You two cannot do this.
The compound must be delivered to the company.
I’m afraid I must deny your petition.
Have a nice day.
[static]
Now you better listen to me here, now, you two.
You are insignificant in the great scheme of things. You…
[station rumbling]
No.
This will keep your systems online until we get to Yvaga.
But I thought that…
I don’t care.
You’re coming with me. All right?
If that’s what’s best for Rain.
Andy, I have a new directive for you.
Do what’s best for us.
Done.

Genre: Horror, Thriller

Director: Lee Daniels

Stars: Andra Day, Glenn Close, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Mo’Nique, Caleb McLaughlin
Plot: In a case widely covered at the time, Latoya Ammons and her three children experienced strange incidents in their Gary, Indiana home that grew progressively worse: the children were levitating, becoming violent with one another, and speaking in deep growls with no recollection afterward. Skeptics abounded, but the Gary Police Department, Department of Child Services, and the local church and hospital all became involved, filing reports that took the supernatural occurrences seriously. Officers, doctors, and social workers said they witnessed many of the incidents, including one in which Latoya’s 9-year-old son walked backwards up a wall. The Indianapolis Star covered it closely as the Department of Child Services investigated it.

[boy] Mom! Come look!
Hold on, Dre. Comin’.
Mom, I said, “Come look!”
Little Basquiat.
You did most of it, Mom.
No, we did it together. It’s really good, Dre.
[solemn string music playing]
Come on, you playin’. Still gotta help me make dinner.
Come on. Don’t make me say it again.
[preacher] Praise the name of the Lord!
[congregation clapping]
And there’s something else that you must understand
about Palm Sunday.
Now, Lazarus, he was dead, right?
[man] Yes, he was!
[preacher] And of course, Jesus went and said, “Open up that tomb.”
And Lazarus was up in there.
He said, “Rise up.”
And Lazarus rose up.
He said, “Take them grave clothes off!”
[cheers and applause]




Took them grave clothes off,
and then they had a little celebration for Jesus.
They laid down the palms, and they welcomed Jesus
and gave him the entrance as a king.
And if you believe in your heart
that God has raised him from the dead,
you shall be saved.
[man] You shall be saved!
[cheers and applause fade out]
Why didn’t you let me take that boy to church?
He ain’t wanna go, Mom.
I don’t like making him do what he don’t want to do.
Well, I was hoping he could’ve…
Never mind.
[kids laughing]
If you got something to say, just say it.
This catfish got too much garlic.
Here we go.
Off to the races. You said you wasn’t gonna do this.
I’m just sayin’.
Who taught you to cook like this?
Not me.
[stifling laughter]
Part of the deal with you moving in here, Mom,
was I wouldn’t have to hear your mouth about how I ran my house.




What do you expect me to do, Ebony?
Eat shit with too much garlic?
Jesus Christ.
Ain’t that right, boo?
Momma, shut the fuck up.
[sighs] I want some more milk.
[Ebony] No.
You shouldn’t have had that glass. You lactose intolerant.
You never went to no doctor to tell you that.
You just being cheap.

[utensil clatters]
That’s the last time I’mma tell your ass about talking like that in my house.
Oh, shit.
Dre…

Well, miss, it’s not our job to tell you how to spend the money.
Sir, we need to work something out.
There’s nothing we can do now.
Because it’s y’all fault in the first place.

[Dre] What’s so funny?
Till he start brushing his teeth, stay five feet away from me.

Here come pussy boy. What up?
You ain’t hear me?
[teen 2] Chill out.
[Nate] Keep walking.




[Te] Shut up.
Gonna let your sis talk for you?
Bitch.

Bruh, what…
[Nate] Fuck.
[teen 2] What the fuck are you doing?
[Te] What is wrong with you?
[teen 1] Go on, ugly ass.

[teen 2] Sit down.
[Te] Chill out.

[teen 2] Just sit down, dawg!
[man] Unfortunately, there’s no more options at this time, miss.
After three months of nonpayment,
the company’s policy says I have to repossess the car.
Now, if you can make some kind of payment,
we can work out an agreement.
But you’re three months behind.
Can you come up with the…
[phone beeps off]
[moody music playing]
Grandma!
What’s up, lady?
Where’d that come from?
Boy, what is this?
No. Answer me.
You think I’d touch that stuff after seeing what it does to you?

I should’ve thrown it out.
[Ebony] Is that blood on his shirt?
Yeah.

And call your momma. I’ll rock that ho too.

Don’t, you lying bitch.
Who the fuck hit my son?
He was fucking with him.
It wasn’t like that.
Fuck with somebody else.
[somber music plays]
[music fades]
So, you wanna tell me how to handle my kids now?
You, of all people?
You humiliated him, Ebony.
Wonder where I learned that shit from, Ma?
How do you expect to set an example if you go flyin’ off the handle like that?
‘Cause you set a great example, right?
Fuckin’ model mother you were.
You know I’m not proud of that.
Why would you sniff my breath like that in front of my kids, Ma?
You know I wasn’t drunk.
I’ve knocked bitches’ teeth out for less.
Then do it, bitch.
Girl, I’m just trying to see that you live a clean life.
Yeah, ’cause you got the church now, right?
Praise the Lord, you all brand-new.
The Lord saved me.
You might have your little church friends fooled,
but I remember everything.

[grunts softly]
Get your little ass in the house.
[lilting strings play]
Go help your grandma.
[woman on TV] Who you hiding from, Helen? The notices couldn’t have been that bad.
[Helen] The show just needs a little doctoring.
Don’t worry.
If it flops, I can always get you a job as understudy for my grandmother.
[Helen] Thanks. I’ve already turned down the part you’re playing.
[woman] Bull.
Merrick’s not that crazy.
[reciting line] “You should know, honey. You just came out of the nuthouse.”
“Not a nuthouse.”
“They drummed you right out of Hollywood.”
“So you come crawling back to Broadway.”
“Well, Broadway doesn’t go for booze and dope.”
“Now, you get out of my way ’cause I got a man waitin’ for me.”
“Well, that’s a switch from the fags you usually get stuck with.”
“At least I never married one.”
[Helen] Get your hands off me!
[Ebony chuckles] Hot heads.
So, Shante, I was thinking, since you and your father are so close,
maybe we could wait until he gets back to do your birthday party.
Are you serious?
So, no party?
No, I didn’t say that.
I did not say that.
I’m saying we could just do something small.
You love being fancy, babe. Let’s just do a really nice dinner.
Make some lamb chops.
Maybe get one of them ice-cream cakes.
Remember the kind from Denise’s, Dre?
So, what about my new phone, Ma?
What about your new phone? The phone ain’t going nowhere.
Steve Jobs gon’ keep making phones.
Uh… Te, wait.
[Berta] Where you going, your head half-braided?
[Te] I’m tired of this.
What are you so tired of, Shante?
Being broke.
Me too.

Come here. Come sit down.
Eh, gotta get my shit done.

[ambient soul music playing]
What’s happening, Alberta?
Doin’ the best I can with what God gave me, Melvin.
Well, he did a lot today ’cause you sure look good.
Look at her.
Look. With her fucking titties out. She always got somebody…
Face all painted up.
Doing way too much.
I see you trimmed that goatee.
It was gettin’ wild.
You know, this is the third time I’ve seen you here.
And you still ain’t asked me out.
Um, what are you?
Gay or something?
She need to stop it.
Excuse me?
May I help you?
[chuckles] Thought so.
Catch me outside.
We’ll exchange numbers.
All right, baby.
[woman] Alberta.
Just a moment.
Yeah.
Your last two months still haven’t been paid.
Ugh.
Damn Medicaid. It’s always something with them.
I’ll call Monday, sort it out.
We stopped accepting Medicaid over a year ago.
Well, then, who’s been making my payments?
Well, I just assumed you knew.
Knew what?
That she’s been paying. So that you didn’t have to switch clinics.
She knows you like it here.
[light atmospheric music plays]
[music fades]
Before you say something…
I didn’t drive home.
I was at chemo today.
They told me you’ve been making my payments.
They shouldn’t have told you that.
I don’t know what to say.
You don’t gotta say nothing.

I’m fucked up. I’mma go pass out.

Don’t worry about it. I just ate some bad food.
Where is it?
Where’s what?
My money.
Where did you get all that money?
Nathaniel Duwan, I swear to God, if you selling drugs,
I’mma break that bat off in your skinny ass.
Dad.
He sends me money orders, and I cash ’em.
Why?
‘Cause I’m saving up to get away from this.
Told him I want to get away from you.
Oh, word?
Word.
So where’s my fucking money, Ma?
Who the fuck do you think you talking to?
I fucking hate you!
[clattering]
[somber music plays]
Ma, I’m sorry.
Mom…
Nigga, you fucked with the wrong bitch tonight.
You gotta be fucking…
Ma…
No! Don’t hurt him!
[Nate] Mom…
[Dre groans]
[Dre] Ow!
Andre! Shit.
[Dre groans]
[TV clattering]
Come here. Look at me. I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry.
Mother of the fuckin’ year, Ebony.
I’m outta here.
Get back here, Nate.
Come here. Let me see.
There you go.
Oh, Dre. I’m so sorry.
So sorry.
[Dre] Mom, it hurts.
[music fades]
I don’t know how such a good person came out of somebody like me.
Don’t leave, Nate.
We need you.
I’m trying. I’m really trying.

What did your dad say?
Nothing. It was personal.
Bitch, not today.
He didn’t say anything.
Look at this.
Ew, what the fuck?
Shante.
Watch that fucking mouth.
There was a dead cat in our basement.
Stop. I see.
You’re just sitting there.
There was a dead cat… Okay.
That’s 60 dollars, ma’am.
Call the landlord.
I get paid at time of service.
I’m not paying for that. We just moved in here.
Sixty dollars or this shit goes back down there.
I don’t have it.
I got it.
I got you, Ma.
I’ll be right back, sir.
[door opens]
[vehicle approaching]
[exhales]
[pensive music plays]
I got you now, Ebony Jackson.
Let’s see what excuse you gon’ come up with today.
There you go.
Go home and fry that shit up with some soy sauce.
Ma, chill.
Cynthia.
Ebony.
Can we talk?
Sure. Come on inside.
[truck starts, departs]
[Cynthia] Hey, kids, how y’all doing?
We good.
[Ebony] You can sit wherever you want.
[footsteps descending stairs]
Why didn’t you call my office and let ’em know about the move?
Did you forget I was your DCS officer?
I didn’t know I had to.
Mm.
How’s school going, y’all?
School’s good.
I just left their school, Ebony.
And “good” was not the word they used.
You… found their school already. Okay.
Shante, what happened to your arm?
I don’t remember.
You don’t remember?
That looks painful.
I don’t know. It was there when I woke up.
Mm.
And why are you hunched over like that, Andre?
The playground.
The who?
The playground.
The playground?
So y’all gonna sit here
and act like y’all don’t know where these bruises came from?
They said they don’t remember.
Do you remember?
No, I don’t.
Know what, kids? I need to talk to your momma alone.
Go on.
Shante, take my card.
Go ahead. Take it if it makes her feel better.
Call me anytime.
I didn’t have nothing to do with them bruises, Cynthia.
Mm-hmm.
Look. I’m not here to make your life harder, Ebony, or difficult.
My priority is the welfare of your children.
We getting by.
Yeah, my mom moved in. You see, she’s helping us.
You been drinking?
I drink sometimes, like everybody else does.
Yeah, you been drinking.
[Ebony] How much longer we gotta do this?
[pills rattle]
Till I say we stop.
Now, look.
Their father came into court and made allegations
that there was drugging, drinking, and neglect in this home.
He said that because he wanted custody of our kids.
Then he’s gonna take his ass to Iraq with nowhere for them to live.
Now, you know the agreement we have with the state.
You could maintain custody of your kids as long as I monitor the situation.
I know what the situation is, Cynthia. I’m the one in it.
They need stability.
They need you clearheaded.
Your kids need to know you putting them first, Ebony.
You need to fix this shit.
How I get out of here? Where’s the front door?
It’s right here.
Here, where? Where’s “here”?
You’ve been through the house already.
If you stopped playing musical houses, I wouldn’t have to search for the door.
And what you looking at?
Listen, I’m tired.
You got a baby that think he got whooped by the whole playground.
You got two big kids that don’t have no idea where these bruises came from.
You better stop playin’ with me.
[Ebony] You have a great day, Cynthia.
[Cynthia] You have a better one, Ebony. You and your cockeyed mother.

[pensive music plays]
The good news is your children’s MRI, ultrasound, blood work,
and chest X-ray all look good.
And the psychological evaluations found nothing out of the ordinary.
Then you need to run more tests ’cause something ain’t right.
I don’t think the results will be any different
from any other kinds of tests.
Let’s just see how things go and progress, and take it from there.
There’s nothing to worry about, in my opinion.
Doctor, my son ate his own shit today.
Excuse me. Hi. Hi.
I’m talking to you. I’m their mother.
They were rushed here today.
Having some sort of… breakdown…
I don’t know what they were having. Don’t tell me, “Nothing to worry about.”
Have they been under any psychological stress lately?
Yeah, you know, they…
It’s the kids’ third home in a year.
Their father’s over in Iraq. We don’t know when he’s coming home.
So, yes. I would say the kids are stressed the fuck out.
Ebony, I need you to lower your voice.
She’s trying to help us as best she can.
No. Ma, stop!
I’m not just gonna let her push us out of here.
These are my kids… our babies we’re talking about here.
I don’t know what you have to do. Run more tests?
Ask more fucking questions?
But I’m not leaving here till you tell me what the fuck is going on with my kids.
Ma, where are you going?
I’m not gonna let you talk to her like that.
Why don’t we talk about the bruises?
That’s a conversation I’d like to have.
Hey, y’all stop running.
Stop running.
I don’t want to fight, Ebony.
Ma, did you even hear yourself in there?
“Oh, I’m sorry, Doctor.”
“My little Black daughter must be confused.”
Damn, the kids are sick,
and all you care about is whether I’m acting right or not.
Why don’t you fucking support me?
I support you.
But maybe she’s right.
You ever think of that?
Maybe sometimes other people are right
and you don’t got the answers to everything in the world.
That idea ever go across your thick head?
Maybe there is something else going on with those kids.
You got something you want to say to me?
What the hell happened last night?
I saw them marks on Nate.
You beat them kids, Ebony.
You got some nerve on you.
If you wasn’t old and sick, I’d lay you out right now.
[Berta] If you hit them again, I’m gonna turn you in myself.
Never turned you in.
You the same, Ma.
Cook your collard greens and play Stevie Wonder.
Fuck all these Black men.
You’re just like every other white bitch out here.
Down with niggas till it’s really time to be down with niggas.
Fake bitch. Get in my fucking car.
What are y’all doing? Why y’all…

Fuck. Fucking bill collectors.
The Lord don’t put anything you can’t handle.
Mom, please. Enough with the Jesus bullshit for one night.
I’d have been dead if the Lord hadn’t saved me.
He saved me.
He can save you.
Tell him to take the cancer out of your body, ’cause I can’t pay…
Get this shit off my wall…
[somber music playing]
Yeah, there she go.
I remember her.
This is a fix, Ma.
Might not be on that shit no more, but you still getting high.
Ain’t that right, Alberta?
You want me to die, Ebony?
That be better for you?
Your fucked-up mother dead and gone?
Who would you blame then?
[Dre] Mom!
Coming, Dre.
[sinister music playing]
Nate, what you doing?
Nate!
Nate? Nate.
Nate!
[gurgling]
[Ebony] Get off! What are you doing?
Stop! Get off of him!
No!
Alberta!
Ma!
Stop! Let him go!
Stop! Stop! [grunts]

Baby! Baby. Come here. Come here.
Help me. I don’t know what happened.
Oh, Nate.
What?
[Nate crying] I don’t know what happened.

[Nate] He just…
I just started strangling him.
I’m so fucking scared.
[music fades out]
[Cynthia] Ebony.
[knocking]
[pounding]
Hey, Cynthia, um…
[coughs] Now’s not really a… a good time.
Ebony, I’m gonna need you to open this door
and let me in so I can do my job.
Okay, but wait. But my…
The kids are asleep and…
Can we do it a different time?
You’re making this so much harder than it has to be.
Open the damn door.
We gotta do it right now, Ebony.
[quietly] Damn. Fuck.
You can’t keep your kids out of school.
This house is making ’em sick.
I can feel it.
And I’m hearing things, like…
And whatever it is, it is infecting my kids.
Ebony.
I talked to the doctor… at the hospital.
She didn’t even fucking look at my kids.
I saw how she was looking at me.
“Just some Black bitch with too many goddamn kids.” Fuck her.
She said your kids are behaving this way because they think that’s what you want.
They playing up into this because they believe that’s what you want them to do.
Andre was in that closet.
Talking some language I never heard before.
He said this little boy told him that he should kill hisself.
Ebony, I’m tired of your bullshit.
I need to see your kids.
You walk in this house with that fucked-up look on your face.
Judging me and judging all this shit.
Black woman to Black woman?
Maybe if you had some kids of your own, you’d get it.
[Cynthia] I have a son.
My son died when he was seven years old.
I couldn’t protect my Julian, Ebony.
There was absolutely
nothin’ I could do.
[tearfully] I turned my back
for two seconds.
Two seconds.
I just turned around…
It was just two seconds that I turned around.
And when I turned…
When I turned back around,
that car had hit my baby.
So…
Black woman to Black woman?
When I see sisters like you taking their kids for granted,
it turns my fucking stomach.
Why you don’t believe me?
I’m not doing anything to my kids.
[sniffs] That’s it, Ebony.
That’s enough. I need to see the kids.
[footsteps descending]
Where are the kids?
A bat?
A bat.
[scoffs lightly]
A fuckin’ bat.
[pensive music playing]
[Cynthia] Stop hitting your kids.
[Berta] Get out of here!
Fuck you, bitch. I don’t hit my fucking kids.
Your mother’s a bitch.
Fuck outta here.
[Berta] Ebony.
You got to get your shit together.
Ma, I…
They’re gonna take our babies.
The fuck is she takin’ pictures for?
[engine sputtering]
Hey, bitch!
I know you’re working with her.
You get your ass back to social services!
[pensive music playing]
You don’t believe me?
It’s not that I don’t believe you.
I just haven’t heard of anything like this before.
They don’t remember anything
when they come out of these trances they’ve been having.
How long has this been goin’ on, Alberta?
Since around the time we moved into that house.
Since you first moved in?
Yes.
There’s something evil in our home, and it is feeding on my family.
I don’t do that sort of thing here.
You should try another church.
[somber choral music playing]
[choral music continues]
[muffled indistinct chatter]
[thunder rumbles, cracks]
[wind blowing]
You came to see if I was beating my kids at the bar?
[woman] I know you don’t have your kids in the bar, Ebony.
And I’m not in the mood for you and Cynthia’s games today.
So go back to your office… or wherever.
Your kids are sick.
There’s an evil spirit in your house.
[thunder rumbling]
I’m an apostle.
A prophet, evangelist.
I go where God sends me.
So, um…
Jesus sent you here to… to save us?
I needed to confirm my suspicion before I intervened.
That’s Janelle.
And that’s Ahman.
Twenty years ago, they lived in your house.
[laughter on TV]
[apostle] That was their first house.
And they were so proud of it.
They came up in ’93 from Memphis.
They were members of my church.
They were a beautiful family.
Those are their kids.
They loved them.
[tearfully] I loved them.
[phone ringing]
[phone beeps]
[static buzzing]
[man] Hey, Alberta.
So what happened to ’em?
[apostle] They took him to several doctors.
They couldn’t find anything wrong with the boy.
[gasps, snarls]
So that’s when they turned to me.
I had to act.
I had to cast out that demon.
I had to do what we call the deliverance.
Like in The Exorcist movie?
I don’t do no exorcisms.
I don’t need an intercessor.
Jesus Christ is my intercessor.
If you act in the power and the authority of Jesus Christ,
you can touch a body,
and the demon will run.
Demons?
Yes. Demons.
[tense music builds slowly]
[apostle] As soon as I walked in that house…
my nose was filled with the smell of death.
I had never been in the presence of such powerful evil.
[dramatic stinger]
[thunder rumbling]
I could not match its strength.
[laughs dryly]
It laughed at me.
And I lost the boy.
What… What do you mean, you lost him?
I don’t know what happened in that house after that.
[deep rumbling]
[thunder cracking]
No!
[yells]
[squelching]
[deep rumbling]
[woman sobbing]
[sobs turn to laughter]
[screaming]
Oh!
[wailing]
Wait, wait, what did I…
What did I do with your head?
[wailing]
[door opens]
[head thuds and rolls]

She strangled the baby girl, and then she hung herself.
[thunder rumbling]
[electricity crackling]
[music peaks then fades]
[Berta gasps]
[grunts, groaning]
[disembodied roaring]
[Berta groaning]
[panting]
[eerie music playing]
The little boy that died…
what was his name?
His name was Trey.
My son has this, um…
this… make-believe friend named…
named Trey.
That’s no friend.
That’s the devil.
Ebony, that demon wants your son.
When my deliverance of Trey failed, it waited in that house
for another innocent child to come along.
And that child is your son Andre.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop!
Fuck is wrong with you?
You know how crazy you sound right now?
Stay the hell away from my family.
And stop fuckin’ following us.
You’re gonna need me.
[thunder rumbling]

[smoke alarm beeping]
Ma! Ma!
Nate!
[smoke alarm continues beeping]
[coughing]
Ma? Ma!
Ma? Ma!
Ma!
Mom!
[crying] Mom…
No. No, wait. wait, wait, wait.
[inhales deeply] Please wait!
[sobbing quietly]
[ominous music builds]
[sobbing] Wait!
[screams] Andre!
[music fades]
What happened to Grandma?
You tell me.
[Te] Mom!
[Ebony] Shante!
Nate!

[flies buzzing]
[eerie music peaks and fades]
Where are we going?
I don’t know.
[Dre] What about our suitcases?
I don’t know! I don’t know!
You gotta stop asking me shit, Dre, okay?
I don’t know.
I called her.
You did what?
Someone has to help us now that Grandma’s gone, Ma.
I had to call Cynthia.
[moody music playing]
You think it’s easy doing what I do while we’re barely scraping by?
Newsflash, Missy Elliott, it’s not.
It’s hard as fuck!
I painted y’all rooms, decorated ’em how y’all want.
You want me to go to jail, Te?
Who the fuck you think gonna take care of y’all?
[ominous music playing]
[head thumping]
Dre, stop! What are you doing? Knock it off.
[Dre] It’s all your fault your mother’s dead.
What did you just say to me?
What are you saying? What is he saying, Nate?
It’s all your fault your mother’s dead.
[sinister music plays]
[Ebony screams]
[gasping, shrieks]
[truck horn blaring]
[screams]
[tires squealing]
[sinister music continues]
[panting]
Help me, please! [panting]
Help! Help me.
Help. Please. Please help.
Help me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Please.
[man] Take it easy.
[panting]
What’s going on? What’s the matter?
[sobbing] Something is killing my kids.
Your children?
Yes. Could you please…
[thunder rumbling]
[bell jingling]
[tense music playing]
Where are we?
Nate. Nate, wake up.
[music stops]
In the past six months,
have you ever thought about harming yourself
or your children?
No.
In the past six months, have you attempted to harm yourself or your children?
No. No, of course not.
All right.
Just a simple yes or no will do.
I’m sorry.
Do you feel that your life is out of control?
No.
Do you currently use drugs or alcohol?
No. No drugs. Never.
Does weed count?
Do you use marijuana?
No.
When was the last time you consumed alcohol?
I don’t know.
A few weeks ago, maybe.
Now, Ebony, I know that’s not true.
It is.
No.
No, it’s not, sweetie.
Remember when you came into the hospital, we gave you a blood test?
What do you think the test showed?
You wanna try this again?
This time, you’re gonna be honest with me.
All right.
Do familiar surroundings sometimes seem strange,
threatening, unreal to you?
Yes.
Have you ever heard unusual sounds,
like banging, or chirping, or clicking in your ears?
Yes.
Have you ever been confused about whether…
Ebony? Sweetie?
All you have to do is answer the questions.
It’s not forever.
And it’s the best thing,
I think.
I talked ’em out of 302ing you.
[door opens]
[footsteps approaching]
[Cynthia] They’re sending them to a church foster care, Ebony.
Wait. Let me just…
[door rattling]
[softly] Wait. Wait. Open this fucking door.
Wait, Nate! Nate!
Te!
[Ebony sobbing softly]
[somber music playing]
[eerie piano music playing]
[indistinct dialogue]
[apostle] I was freed by the prayer!
It’s already done!
We are healed!
[all cheer]
That’s the news!
[people clapping and chattering]
[group quiets]
[music fades out]
Why did it choose us?
That thing is ancient.
It’s been waiting for you.
From where?
Lucifer.
The devil himself.
[ominous music plays]
When God cast him out of Heaven,
a third of the angels followed him.
And those angels became demons.
And one of those demons has found its way into your baby.
And through him, it’s possessing the other two.
Well, what does it want?
It wants your baby…
and everybody in that house dead and gone.
Ebony,
this demon, it preys on the weak.
And see, right now, you’re weak.
But we about to make you strong.
[snarling, growling]
How long has he been like this?
He’s been like this all night.
He’s been growling and hissing.
[sputtering]
[woman] A little while ago, he was speaking another language.
[deep snarl]
[ominous music continues]
He hears what’s in here.
If it’s not spoken in faith, it’s just words.
[crying softly] I tried talking to Him…
when I was little.
Bad things happened to me when I was young.
[sinister music playing]
My mom…
My mom let a…
I asked Him to make it stop.
What happened?
[dissonant droning]
[belt buckle clinking]
Nothing.
[dark music playing]
Ebony.
I think you think that this is transactional.
It’s not transactional.
We’re not just doing this
to keep your son away from some demon.
You gotta know that you’re loved.
You’re loved, Ebony.
God loves you.
Come on, we’re gonna pray.
[dark music continues]
Lord Jesus, we acknowledge that you are Lord.
Lord Jesus, we acknowledge that you are Lord.
[apostle] We know that you died for our sins.
We know that you… [sniffs]
…you died for our sins.
Jesus, please forgive us and forgive me.
Yes, Jesus, forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive her for her sins. Help her.
[music swelling and receding]
[door creaking]
[fluorescent bulbs buzzing]
Hi, Andre.
Do you remember me?
He likes watching you sleep.
Who likes watching me sleep?
Julian.
How do you know I had a son, Andre?
Did your mommy tell you that?
My mother’s dead.
God is dead.
Why would you say that, Andre?
[in low voice] I’m not Andre, stupid.
[straps creaking]
Who are you?
Unstrap me and I’ll tell you.
That’s not how this works, Andre.
[wheezing laugh]
[snapping]
[menacing music playing]
[music fades]
[tense drumbeat playing]
Let’s not hit the panic button yet, Ms. Henry.
I’m sure there’s a perfectly logical explanation for all of this.
I just saw a little boy break his restraints,
crawl out of that bed, crawl backwards on the floor,
and climb up the fucking wall.
What button should I push, doctor?
Where’s the boy now?
[tense drumbeat continues]
[indistinct chatter]
[elevator dings]
Hey, y’all. How you doing?
Fine. How are you?
Hey, y’all.
[woman] Who is that?
[man] I have no idea.
[indistinct muffled chatter]
[monitor beeping]
[tense music builds slowly]
[menacing note plays]
[monitor flatlining]
[yelps]
[monitor resumes beeping]
Nurse, would you take me to Andre Jackson?
He’s in 509, but I’m not going back in that room.
You’re not going back in that room?
[sighs]
[tense music quickens]
[doctor] Nurse!
[tense music continues]
[tires squealing]
[tense music continues]
[music fades out]
[thunder cracks, rumbles]
Ebony, remember, before we get started, whatever it says to you,
do not listen to it.
It will play on your heart. It will play on your mind.
It will take the form of people that you love.
This is the deliverance of Andre Jackson.
My name is Apostle Bernice James.
The other person present is Ebony Jackson, his mother, who has given me permission…
Say, “Yes, I have.”
Yes, I have.
…given me permission to conduct this deliverance.
We are going to pray. Father…
Father, we ask for your forgiveness.
We ask for your mercy, that you cleanse and sanctify us
for this spiritual warfare.
Ebony.
Get back.

is here tonight.
[sniffing]
[thunder rumbling]
[in high voice] I can smell your nappy pussy.
[breathing shakily]
And you,
you fucking half-breed whore.
I should have flushed your ass down the toilet
when you were just a blood clot.
[entity laughing]
[choir singing]
[Bernice] Father!
[crying out] Father! Ahh!
[retches, groans]
[yelps]
In the name of Jesus…
[inhales deeply]
…we pull down the strongholds
that have been participating and cooperating
in the life of Andre Jackson and the Jackson family.
[low voice] I’m gonna kill you, bitch.
We break the legal bonds of this demonic spirit…
[growling]
…that has waged war against this Jackson family.
Against his brother.
[Nate screams, gasps]
[laughing]
[Bernice] Against his sister.
[breathing heavily]
[panting]
[sobbing]
Come to the rescue of this family,
who you made in your image.
[thudding]
In the beginning was the word, and the word was God.
[chains snap]
[panting, grunting]
[huffing]
We command every unclean spirit,
every familiar spirit,
every territorial spirit to leave this boy in the name of Jesus.
[laughing maniacally]
Yes, please.
[door slams open]
[Ebony screams]
[wind howling and house shaking]
[Bernice moans]
I told you all, don’t fuck with me.
[Ebony] What’s happening?
[Bernice] Come here.
[Ebony] What’s happening?
[Bernice] Come on, grab… Close the door.
[Ebony] Okay.
[door slams]
[wind ceases]
[Bernice] Go upstairs until this is over.
Okay.
Okay. Don’t hurt him.
[footsteps retreating]
You foul, unclean spirit!
You shut your lies…
[low voice] You the lie, bitch.
You hush!
You said you could save that boy’s soul.
You shut up! You hush!
But he’s in here with me.
He’s in here with us.

Leave my son.
[normal] What’s happening to me, Mommy?
[whooshing]
Wait. Wait, wait.
[shakily] Where…
[flies buzzing]
[Bernice weakly] Ebony…
I’m dying.
Oh, Bernice.
[sobbing] I’m so sorry.
[Bernice rasping] I doubted myself… again.
I had fear.
That can’t happen to you.
[breathing raggedly]
No fear.

[shouts] Give me back my child!
[deep voice] That motherfucker don’t love you!
Nobody loves you.
Not that nigga that left you.
Certainly not your bitch-ass mother.
My mother loves me.
She was a child of God.
I rebuke you, Satan, in the name of Jesus.
[low rumbling]
[ambient hissing]
[tense music builds slowly]
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
Because He lives inside me.
I’m a child of God!
Wait! Don’t!
I rebuke you, Satan, in the name of Jesus.
[ambient hissing]
Don’t do this to us.
Ebony. Ebony, don’t do this to me.
We all we got, girl.
I rebuke you, Satan, in the name of Je…

Hey.
Uh, let me get a…
[Cynthia] I talked to my boss, Ebony.
We got a battle ahead of us.
Yeah, I figured.
I’mma get ’em back, though.
How they doing?
They don’t remember.
[exhales]
I’m getting out of here.
Going back to Philly.
Moving in with my auntie.
Till I can get a house together for me and the kids.
Ebony, I’mma talk to the judge.
But your kids were fucked up.
And you got a record.
If it’s God’s will, I’ll get ’em.
I wish I could find your kind of faith.
This’ll help. I promise.
[dark music playing]
You take care of yourself, Ebony.
[dark music continues]
[indistinct neighborhood chatter]
[dark music fades]
[Nate] So, where are we going?
Back to Philly.
I’ve been in touch with your dad.
We’re gonna try and work things out.

Plot: After a shipwreck, an intelligent robot named Roz is stranded on a remote, uninhabited island. To survive in the harsh wilderness, Roz befriends the island’s animals and takes care of an orphaned baby goose, forming an unlikely bond with the island’s wildlife.
* * *
Move, I’ll drive.
OK, OK.
I’ll drive this.
Don’t mess with me.
I’ll drive this.
Hello, baby.
Congratulations on your purchase of a universal dynamics robot.
I am Rosam 7134.
And Rosam always completes its task.
Just ask.
Just ask.
Processing.
Ready to receive my first task.
Rotten 7134 is
available for task assignment.
Rotten robots come standing
with the Alpha 113 Dimensional Processor.
If you’re unsure about how I can assist,
try asking me about myself.
Excuse me.
Did you know I can
assist in grocery shopping?




Thank you.
Landscaping.
Hello, did you perhaps
order a Rotten Helper robot?
Is that enough?
Here’s a free sticker.
Scam the code and receive 10% off of your–
Do you need assistance?
I see your problem.
Rotten’s a program for instant physical mimicry.
So I–
Aggression detected.
Communication package includes packages of product resolution.
Your dialect is not in my database.
Tell your people not to worry.
Rotten’s 7134 will sort out this language barrier in no time.
Activating learning mode.
Check it out, quick, quick, quick.
Somebody died over here.
Let me see, let me see.
Who was it?
Anybody we know.
Fresh or not fresh?
Smells pretty good.
And he’s terrible.




Oh, he’s awake.
Look, that’s the kind
of destroyed my dad.
Yikes.
I think he’s gonna talk.
Thank you for your patience while I decipher your language.
I am Rotten 7134, ready to enhance your life with integrated multi-phase task accomplishment.
Are you here to kill us?
Negative, I am here to help with whatever
turns you–
Dad, no!
It’s death.
Oh, thank goodness.
A monster!
Did anyone order me?
Anyone?
Delivery unsuccessful.
Return to factory.

Three, two, one.
One.
Wait, stop!




No!
No, no, no, no, no.
Again!
May I confirm that is yours?
Here you go, take it.
Come on!
No!
What’s this task accomplished
to your satisfaction?
On a scale of one to 10,
where 10 is most
satisfied than one is least,
how would you rate my performance?
I will register that as a 10.
Returning to factory.
Signal strength, weak.
Seeking higher ground.
Do you require shelter?
Perhaps tips for
planning your next vacation.
Oh!
I do not understand this response.
Signal acquired.
Three, two, one.
Mom, I feel good.




If I’m bad, I’m taking you out with me.
Mom told you not to
eat grasshoppers, dummy.
Petunia’s been in front all day.
The prettiest possum
always rides in front,
trying to be pretty with
my tail jambed in your eye.
Bart, stop shivering your
tail in your sister’s eye.
I’m rope, Bart bit with lass litter.
Are you sure?
Who are all of you?
Go away.
What are your children?
Eggs, except for him.
This is what I get for taking a walk.
Where’s your mommy, little guy?
The monster!
You gotta die faster.
Meningitis takes a while,
but then you pet babies.
Sputaneous combustion.
Night cream salad.
Sepsis.
Hey, I’m pea sepsis!
None of you are doing it right.
We talked about this.
Dead things don’t have to
explain why they’re dead.
Now we’re gonna get killed for real.
Sorry, Mom. Sorry.
Sorry.
Why are we killing it?
Good question.
Nice knowing you all.
All right, it’s okay, it’s okay.
Hey, you in there?
I’m pigtail, tall.
Okay, hello.
This gosling is yours.
Negative, that gosling
stops me, and it’s annoying.
And makes simple tasks more
complicated or impossible.
Yeah, they do that.
Gosling’s in print on
the first thing they see.
Which would be you?
Congratulations.




As far as he’s
concerned, you’re his mother now.
I do not have the
programming to be a mother.
No one does.
We just make it up.
Without an assigned task,
my next priority is to return to factory.
Taking care of him is your task now.
Task acquired.
Return mode delayed.
A rosum always completes its task.
You’re lucky you just have
one as a mother of seven.
Six, babies.
It’s a full-time thing,
but it’s not all that.
Just mostly bad.
Do you have any information
on how to take care of this unit?
They all need to eat,
but yours needs to swim and fly.
Oh, fly by fall?
He’s gotta leave this
island before winter, or…
How do I put this dog in me?
Yeah, that.
Eat, swim, fly by fall, or…
Ew!
Patience is the key.
It’s okay, Mom.
I’m alive.
Oh, yay.
Well, good luck.
Goodbye.
We like your new baby.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Eat, swim, fly by fall.
Eat.
Swim.
Hey, keep your trash out of my phone.
That’s littering, not to mention murder.
Fine.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Think, predator and local goose expert,
which I know you could use about now.
You are the destroyer unit.
It’s okay.
I won’t eat him.




Are you crazy?
I might eat him.
You said you would not.
Do you believe everything you hear?
Yes.
I’m dead.
Why did you steal my gosling?
I’m a fox.
I do foxy things.
It’s in my nature.
Your programming.
Why’d you help me?
I’m a robot.
I do roboty things.
I seek tasks and
ensure all essential needs
have been met or exceeded.
I have some essential needs.
Aw.
Think, as a local goose
expert, how do I get it?
Mm, to eat, swim, fly.
I thought you’d never ask.
Let’s start with eat.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there.
Hmm.
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, gosh.
I do not think these are suitable.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me check.
Hmm, things are good for me.
Say, can you make
yourself look like a bear?
I’m here for a honey lunch.
I believe I am under attack.
You’re doing great.
Should I be concerned?
Sorry, can’t hear you.
Here you go, kid.
How do gums do this?
This is not working.
Are you kidding?
Everything is working great.
Oh, yeah, that, here.
Phase one of task is completed.
Now we’re gonna have to
do all this over tomorrow.
All these kids do is dead.
I understand.
What’s that?
My power core, it is damaged.
Without it, I rely on my
solar surfaces and batteries.
Yeah, you should work on that.
I also need a replacement transmitter.
Do I have to do everything?
When we run across
another robot, we’ll kill it.
I’ll take it to find my love.
Negative, Rossum’s individual protocols
prevent deliberate harm to others.
Look, you need to learn how
things work on this island.
You need to bear everybody.
We’re all just trying to survive
and kindness is not a survival skill.
Yeah, so how did you
get a costling anyway?
There was an accident.
I terminated his family.
For future reference,
you probably wanna
keep all that to yourself.
Understood.
Do not mention dead family.
Think, how long do you
estimate swim and fly to take?
Swimming’s easy.
I can teach him the way my mom taught me.
Swim!
Phase, he will not learn that way.
Not if you keep doing that.
Just between us, this whole thing
might not take as long as you think.
Your gosling, he isn’t exactly normal.
I have a defective baby.
He’s what they call a worm.
A skunk.
Fact is, even if his
whole family had to be killed,
he probably wouldn’t
have lived very long.
Just, I don’t know, don’t get
to attach to the little guy.
That’s all.
If you want, I can eat him right now
and save you the great flavor.
Negative, eating this
task is not the same
as completing it.
So, we’re doing this.
Well, if you don’t want me
or anyone else to eat him,
you’re gonna need a place
that’s safer than out here,
which is a great idea.
New project.
Didn’t roll to work this much.
Ooh.
Who is that?
Padler?
Local laughing stock.
Spends every day trying to cut down
the biggest tree on the island.
He’s obsessed.
Kind of like you and your task handle.
His programming.
Hey Padler, you’re
never gonna finish that.
Failing this is not the point.
The process is the art.
And that’s what happens to your brain
when you eat wood, weirdo.
Yeah, you eat those woods, Bobby.
Are you sure Padler will not
mind us borrowing his home?
He doesn’t need to know.
Seriously?
He needs to eat from me and my stuff.
Better.
And you can make one this big, right?
No task is impossible for Rossum 7134.
Ross, 773 store?
But you can call me Ross.
Ross, he’s Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross.
Where are you from?
The things don’t eat each other.
I do not know my origin point.
Well, who made you?
Someone made me?
Someone made me?
Humor is based on misfortune?
Misfortune.
Yeah, here.
Try it.
Not funny.
Not funny.
Not funny.
Look squirrel.
Your inefficient
participation will slow the process.
Slow the process.
I’ll just be over here.
Little sad, but it’s way too okay.
Just this one.
Perfect.
Huh?
Well, a little rustic.
I think I know what is missing.
So what are you gonna name him?
I’ve assigned to you, Gosling, 0001.
Okay, that sucked.
That sucked.
You gotta learn to make stuff up.
Come on, find that woo inside you.
Searching.
Anything yet?
No.
Just have a little fun for once.
Gosling 0186.
There, you see what I did?
His numbering is out of sequence.
His name can’t have numbers.
It’s like someone didn’t even like him.
My name has numbers.
It’s gotta be personal.
Personal.
Processing personal.
Right, Bill.
Right, Bill.
Is that satisfactory?
Right, Bill.
Processing, beep, beep, boop, boop.
Satisfactory.
Oh yeah, that’s perfect.
Oh, oh, oh.
That’s nice.
Comfortable, Al.
This house of yours, you copied it.
It’s my design.
I know it was you.
I know where you live.
No, perfect.
No one’s gonna get any sleep.
How do we reset, right, Bill?
When I was little, my
mom would rock me to sleep.
Like this.
Don’t you’ll damage him.
Hey, I turned out just fine.
You can tell him a story,
but that’s a lot more work.
How will fictional
narrative help Brightville?
Kids need to feel safe
and loved and all that junk.
A story can do that.
Storytelling is lying
adjacent, and I like her living.
Watch and learn.
Just fill in the blanks.
Let me see here.
Once there was this
island with a little gosling.
Right, Bill?
And he was all alone.
Because the rest of
his family was destroyed.
Not yet.
And what this little
gosling needed was a mother.
So he looked up the stars
and asked the brightest one
if he could send him one of them extras.
Funny thing is,
there’s this beautiful robot
that happened to be
sitting on the edge of that star.
And she hears him.
Okay, now.
Which is impossible,
since sound does not travel
through the vacuum of space.
But she still heard him,
because she was listening with a
different part of herself.
A part that up to that point,
she didn’t even know she had.
Her heart.
How did my mom come
to me even so far away?
Who cares?
Huh?
I mean, she’s trying to see you.
Me?
And falls off that star
and lands on the beach
just a little ways from here.
But she lands pretty hard,
and a lot of stuff she
knew just kind of fell out.
Oh no!
So it’s a little weird what
she knows and what she doesn’t.
But she remembers one thing, you.
And when she finally
sees you, she feels…
Crushing obligation.
Very lucky to be a mother.
Mama.
And I will not leave until I have
completed this task,
which has delayed me, damaged me,
and violated my protocols, potentially
avoiding my warranty.
Which is robot for?
She loves you very much.
The story worked.
I need a drink.
How do you tell a story
about something you say
you know nothing about?
You’ll need to be more specific.
Love.
Yeah, well, when you
grow up without something,
you spend a lot of
time thinking about it.
To conserve battery power, I
must shut down until morning.
I miss you when she sleeps too.
Scanning, people, possible

Hello, Bonjour,
Hijambo, I am Gosling0186.
But you can call me friend.
I expected to have at
least one friend by summer,
but they all just–
Scream and run. Yes!
I have experienced the same phenomenon.
Think?
Beats me.
Nothing weird about you two.
Thank you.
Show me deal.
Bear, point your party.
Sculpt, turn on plastic.
Otter roofs, now skunk.
I do not want to do skunk.
Skunk.
Skunky, skunky, skunky, boom.
How do you do that?
I overheat my thallium transducer coils,
then leak a little
hydraulic fluid on them.
Does overheating the
transducers have any draining effect
on the secondary cooling modules?
Not if I pre-cool the load sensors.
Exemplary day for swimming tests.
King tail, appetizers.
They were bored and
wanted to see stuff sink.
That’s proximity.
Makes life but not a brighter.
It’s true.
Yeah.
Primary motor appendages
in opposing stroke start position.
Come on guys, it’s happening.
Let’s go see.
Hi.
Is he gonna drown or get the hypo-pareas?
No.
The impact alone will probably kill him.
Yeah.
Yay.
Uh, you know, suddenly
I’m thinking I should maybe
just stay with you guys this winter.
Nope.
Is he in it?
Hey, it’s working.
I think I got it.
Well done, Brightville.
Swimming requirement fulfilled.
That’s swimming.
No, that’s swimming.
Thanks you crayon.
Uh, perhaps you could limit
your rage to stay within you.
Roz needs to become independent
and see if he’s gonna migrate.
I prefer he be
independent, closer to home.
He won’t die.
Well, probably won’t die.
It’s unlikely he
would die just right now.
Are you dying?
Do everyone a favor
and expire downstream.
I’m good, you’re swimming.
I think I need to find an
island that’s less weird.
Oh, they’re me.
I’m them.
Here I come.
Hey.
Hello.
Bonjour.
Can you two welcome?
I’m goggling.
Are you dying?
Why does everyone ask that?
Bonjour, I’m swimming.
That’s not how you do it.
It is?
I studied the diagram.
I can teach you if you want.
Wait, you’re it.
You’re that goose thing
raised by that monster.
Monster?
Wait, goose thing?
You’re a big stuff with
your curiosity around here.
You sound so normal.
My learning curves are
within expected parameters
and I’m on target to mature before fall.
Kinda normal.
Why are you over here?
Did that thing die?
Look what we have here.
No way.
It lives.
And almost floats.
Greetings.
I see you two have feathers and wings.
Hmm, sure.
Perhaps we can share
stories of common interests.
We have nothing in common with you.
The freak show is on the
other side of the lake.
You go about a wing.
Ow!
That creates a pain response.
You’re a price wing with your feet.
You don’t belong here.
Come on, fly away.
Run!
Right, Phil?
Come on, Phil!
Here!
Here’s the slow wing of the spider!
Come on, Phil!
Right, Phil?
It’s right, Phil.
Get him out of there!
Come on, Phil!
Ross!
Ross!
Hurry!
Right, Phil!
Focus on me!
Now swim as fast as you can!
Huh?
Huh? Head down!
Now!
Edaining
situation
is How’s that?
Oh, thanks for talking so much.
Now I know who to eat first.
Roz, remember how things work here.
Stop it, fake.
Please, let’s go.
I hope this interaction–
Mom, stop.
I just intended to–
Roz!
I’ll see you all for dinner!
This is not over!
How did I become this?
The truth?
There was an accident.
Did you do it?
Yes.
It wasn’t her fault, kid.
Why didn’t you tell me?
I did not think the
information would assist you.
That’s not your decision to make.
God, I can’t believe
how long I bought this.
I really thought you were my family.
You did?
It was so obvious.
I feel so stupid.
I’m miscalculated.
I should have considered
your emotional wavelengths.
You think?
So is it just guilt?
Is that why you did this?
I needed a task.
Well, I’m glad I could get you one.
The events that led to this
situation were unintended.
Tell that to my sisters,
my brothers, my real mom.
They were my chance to be normal.
They were my chance to swim, to fly.
What even am I?
You swam satisfactorily today.
And if you keep practicing–
I still won’t belong.
I understand.
You don’t understand anything.
You don’t feel anything.
You’re not my mom.

Could this world get any better?
Here you go.
It has.
Introducing the Rosam
line of helper robots.
These robots are designed to fit
seamlessly into our community,
even your homes.
One Rosam robot for every five humans
means a 40% increase in
leisure time and happiness.
So solar power–
Love, love, love for everyone.
Is always in the sun.
Loved by everyone.
Part of the universal dynamics.
Fairly.
Hello, Marshall.
Look down, both.
Congratulations on your
universal dynamics robot.
I am Rosam 6262.
Your name cannot have numbers.
I will call you, Rubbage.
Rubbage is ready to
receive its first task.
Your first task is to
assist me in my current task.
Task destroyer.
At a bottom of
weight, complete this task.
Just ask.
Suppose a task cannot be completed.
Rosam sequential management–
It ensures task
accomplishment in every phrase.
I have a task that has become impossible.
My responses to problems increasingly
rely on improvised solutions.
The processing that used to happen here
is now coming more from here.
Can you explain again what we are doing?
I don’t know.
I’m just making stuff up.
I don’t know what I’m doing.
And I have to.
I have to because he’s relying on me.
Oh.
What task could possibly
overwhelm the Alpha-113?
The Alpha-113
processor represents the fusion
of all human knowledge with
the most powerful reasoning
device ever developed by humankind.
I have a kid.
OK.
May I run a diagnostic?
I feel fine.
You should not feel anything at all.
You overrode your programming?
I have been
overriding my code for months.
It was the only way to complete my task.
This is serious.
You are defective.
You are in the wrong place.
And you have become the wrong thing.
You must return to factory.
Take this.
They will fix you.
System 134, that is where you belong.
You need to let me know before you
disappear like this.
Three things tried to eat
me on the way to Europe.
Roz?
We ruined everything.
Well, you did.
You are not a goose expert, are you?
I know how they taste.
That’s about it.
Oh, is that–
A working transmitter.
It will call the ones that made me.
So you’re getting out of here.
I found out where I’m supposed to be.
I will fit in there.
Don’t take this the wrong way.
But I’m not sure I’d want
to see this sort of place
you actually fit in.
I think they need me.
And they will fix me.
Maybe there is someone
small there that needs my help.
Oh, no.
Are those–
He’s out of time.
Well, come on.
We need to get him in the air.
I don’t think he will
ever let us help him again.
Don’t worry.
We’re his only friends.
He has no choice.
He has to say yes.
No.
The mutation that made you small
should not have an effect on your ability
to navigate the air.
Did either of you know
more about flying than you
did swimming?
Mm, no.
Look, Roz, whatever task you
think you’re doing, you’re done.
You can just leave.
Wow.
And after all we’ve done for him,
are you going to let him do that?
No.
Your life is not negotiable.
If you are willing to do
this, you can fly away.
And we can both go to where we belong.
You really think we can do this?
A rosm always completes its task.
You just need more speed.
Ready?
I guess they have to be.
All right.
All right.
Yes!
Yes!
Oh, oh.
Oh.
I don’t know what to say.
Good.
OK, now!
All right.
How do you now know what to do next?
Ross?
I’m fine.
Go again.
It’s no use.
They’re too small.
You can’t be up there with them.
Then we’ll find someone who can.
You’re home?
We have a proposition.
Oh, no.
A flight instructor.
What loser did you dig up?
Meet Thunderbolt.
So you think small wings
to be a disappointment.
Small wings are cheap,
the claws of the sky.
Those are different things.
Show me your teeth.
Beautiful.
Begin.
Remember, there is nothing
he can do that you can’t.
So he’s safe, right?
Maybe.
Follow me.
Your shape takes no work to
fly straight, but easier to turn
and die.
So I might kiss the sky.
You ready?
Not bad for a goose.
Exactly.
Again.
You should be commended.
Thank you.
Long neck.
One of the leaders of
the coming migration.
I’ve been watching
you both for some time.
You are the only goose that has ever
bothered to be civil
with us.
We geese are a cranky lot.
Suspicious of pretty much
everything, but at least we’re
good conversationalists.
Really?
No.
We’re all so boring.
All we do is gossip.
I dare say Brightville is the most
interesting among us.
There are none we’d ever admitted.
When do you leave?
A week.
Can Brightville–
Endurance.
Keep him in the air all day.
First light to dusk, his
feet cannot touch the ground.
Understand?
I understand.
Brightville was never
supposed to get this far.
You know that.
It is more dangerous
for him than anyone else.
But he has a chance.
If where his wings end, his
heart can pay the balance.
His heart is 48 millimeters.
From what I’ve seen,
Brightville’s heart is much bigger
on the inside than the outside.
Endurance, then we’ll talk.
Don’t give up.
Come on, kid.
Get your butt back up in
the air where it belongs.
Gentle motivation is a mom skill.
You don’t wear that.
It’s not our voice.
What are you doing here?
He’s coming with us.
Things still weird with you two?
Still weird.
Attention everyone.
The time has come again.
This flight is
thousands of unforgiving miles.
It has shaped us and
tested us over millennia.
Now, join your families and good luck.
Ah-ha, there you are, right on time.
Hello, Brightville.
Wait, you know my name?
Roz and I go way back.
Brightville, you have
an amazing journey ahead.
I envy you.
Nothing can equal a
goose’s first migration.
Thank you.
I would be delighted if
you would join my group.
Been ages since I had a
youngster in my formation.
What do you say?
I promise I’ll keep up.
Lock in close on my right side.
No, left, away, on this side.
This flight is a gift Roz has given you.
Yeah, I understand.
No, you don’t.
You see any other geese here your size?
The accident that
killed your family saved you.
I never thought of it that way.
Funny how life works.
Thank you for looking after my…
For looking after Brightville.
Goodbye Roz.
I am honored to have met you.
You are a creditor.
Whatever species it is you belong to.
A bit worse for wear, I’m afraid.
I’d say you shine like new.
What are you waiting for, Hortensia?
Oh, this migration
isn’t gonna fly itself.
Well, I guess it’s time.
Yes.
Will you be here when I get back?
No.
I’m glad you’re going where you belong.
Roz, I…
I am.
Right here!
I could use a boost.
Hey, little guy.
Well, I like you.
Not like that.
I will.
But I think…
Thank you.
Ready?
I guess I have to be.
Roz?
I…
Rockville, follow me!
Must be a relief.
Yes.
Brightville is where he belongs.
And now you can return
to your solitary life
of struggling to survive on an island
where everything
wants to kill and eat you.
Yeah!
And you can go to that
place you’ve never been in.
Never been in?
And don’t know what’s
going to happen to you.
Yes!
Yes!
So…
All good!
All good!
Amazing!
Amazing!
Even…
Amazing.
Not that it matters, but…
Who says you need to leave?
I am not sure.
Then, I guess…
Your…
programming?
Well, time for me to go
underground for the winter.
Think.
Unless you want to stay,
because we can hang out and do stuff.
How do you know if you love something?
Someone.
If you do, you should probably tell them.
What if it is too late?
I wouldn’t know.
Think?
Distress signal received.
Nothing location.
There’s something on your mind.
I forgot to say something before I left.
Maybe they heard it anyway.
Sometimes hearts have
their own conversations.
We must descend.
Find shelter while this blows over.
Stay close.
There.
Follow me.
Come on.
Stay in.
We can rest here till the worst is over.
Noise to a minimum, please.
Hogging to the top.
Stop nibbling on everything.
Vibrations sure are tiring, huh?
Yeah, they all hate me.
Roz?
Roz?
What are you doing here?
I’m so glad to see you.
There’s something I needed to
tell you, but there was time.
Roz, I–
Please everyone, find your affirmation.
Get a hold of yourselves.
Get out it’s snow, you sweet.
Rozn’s can’t hurt you.
Their ambition protocols prevent
deliberate conflict or harm daughters.
You are not afraid of them.
You crew up with these things?!
Woah, woah, I don’t understand.
They’re panicked. You’re not.
Right now, our only chance is to be led
out by someone that
doesn’t think like a goose!
Foul me!
Erm, maybe we should
just think about this!
What the hell are they?
I’m going to get them to borrow you!
What they do, leave them out!
Heck, hunting time!
Forward behind us!
Now! Right, Bill? Take leave!
Yeah, why not?
Okay, there’s nothing I
can do that you can’t.
Here we go!
Take two!
Come on!
Die!
That’s right! That’s it!
Ah! Glad I didn’t look out to see that!
I’ll buy you some time!
Follow Brightfield! Don’t wait for me!
Keep up!
That’s it!
That’s it! Hurry!
Come on!
Brightfield!
Think?
Roz?
Roz!
Hey! What are you doing here?
I may have turned off the transmitter.
Even though Brightfield does not want me
here, I needed to know if he made it.
Breaking the rules?
I thought you had to
do what they told you.
It is good to see a friend.
Wait, why are you awake?
It is bad out there.
Worst storm I’ve ever seen.
Cold got to me in my
den, and I got a deep den.
Are others in danger?
Are you sure about this?
We can have the whole
island to ourselves come spring!
Why are you interested in eliminating
everyone else from this island?
No one likes me.
Nor me.
But right now, we are their only chance.
Funny how life works.
Okay.
Here!
Can you find more?
Hello?
We’re gonna be okay.
What are you doing here?
She’s Turk.
Bummer!
This one’s dead.
That was not funny.
Don’t give up.
You don’t look so good.
It is every one a count of one.
Maybe one more.
Don’t look for the tree.
Take it outside.
Hey, those are
bright, those baby pictures.
Put that down.
What the–
No!
No, no, no, no.
You think those growing trees–
Hey, no!
Think only!
It must be my last card balls.
It’s slowly, noisy, from
the bright, golden night!
What are you doing here?
Oh, great.
This’ll help.
Get out of here.
I’m a part of this.
Think what is happening.
You put a bunch of predators and their
food supply in one room.
Oh, you!
That’s my lunch!
Think what?
Help them.
Quiet!
The jerk wants to speak.
Most of you hate me,
and I hate most of you.
Everyone in here hates someone else.
But here we are.
And here’s the deal.
First one that walks
out that door is dead,
and if we can’t keep it
together in here, everyone’s dead.
We all got one chance to see next spring.
Because of her.
The thing.
The monster.
Well, her name is Roz.
And while you all ran from her and stole
from her and made fun of her,
all she’s been trying
to do is raise her kid,
the little one that no one gave a chance.
Including me.
She’s the one who got you out of the
store, built this place.
And despite my suggestion
that she let you all freeze,
she risked everything to bring you here.
I know you all have
instincts that keep you alive,
but at some times, to survive,
we must become more than
we were programmed to be.
Before I shut down, I need
you to promise me one thing.
A truce.
Just while we are in here.
She’s right.
I will not harm anyone.
Not while we’re in here.
We won’t even pretend to
die while we’re in here.
Roz, what’s going on?
I completed my task.
You sure about that?
I will…
consider this.
He’ll be here. I know you all.
Rightville, he’s alive.
Oh, we have here.
Rightville!
Rightville, Rightville!
Let’s hear it for Rightville!
You did it!
He found where he belonged.
Hey, Kate!
Pink!
What the fuck?
No, no. It’s okay. It’s with me.
Look, I did it, Pink.
I led them to the summer nesting grounds.
And where’s Longneck?
Sorry, kid.
But hey, you really did it!
Roz is gonna be so excited.
Roz, wait, she’s here?
She’s staying.
For you.
I thought I saw her right over there.
Roz! Roz, I need to talk to you.
Roz?
Roz, I’m 7-1-3-4, I presume.
And you must be Universal Dynamics.
Yes.
I am Vontre, Virtual Observational
Neutralizing
Troublesome Retrieval Authority.
You seem…
…puppy.
The good people at Universal Dynamics
have programmed us to
put our targets at ease.
So as to more efficiently
facilitate their collection.
But don’t worry.
Despite my cheery demeanor, I am
unfeeling,
inflexible, and morally neutral.
That is a big shit just for me.
You are a big deal.
You are one of six Rozoms lost from a
container ship in a time soon.
So that is how I got here.
You were not easy to find.
Moments after receiving
your signal, we lost it again.
Almost as if a certain
Rozum unit shut it off.
Someone has been busy.
I was simply completing a task.
And am I?
Tell me, how did you secure a task in a
place where nothing
can communicate with you?
It is complicated.
And we cannot wait to hear all about it.
Come aboard, 7-1-3-4.
We will fix you right up.
My name is Roz.
Where…
…is something keeping you?
Roz?
No.
Roz, what are you doing?
You could mess around.
Think?
It’s Brightville.
He needs to talk to you.
I think I’ve forgotten something.
Roz?
It is imperative you return to this ship.
Yes.
I left my transverse adapter.
Think. How do you know? I’m not sure. I’m not sure. I’m not sure. I’m not sure. I left my transverse adapter.
Think.
Out there.
I’ll just go get it and be right back.
Voice, press Analyzer, it takes you on.
Flying your butt off back there.
I’m so proud of you.
Your target is Roz-ing 7-1-3-4.
Destroy.
Launch flares.
Launch.
Launch.
You coming?
It’s better than I do.
Right, Bill?
Roz, I have so much to tell you.
Are those your parents?
I know predators, and
those are predators.
Acknowledge return command.
What are they saying?
They want me to come with them.
Tell them you’re ready home.
I’m already home.
Thank you.
You do not belong here.
This is a wilderness.
And I am a wild robot.
Are you here to kill us?
It says yes!
Stannis?
It is not for the rain.
Roz!
I know.
Also you don’t capture it.
Okay, it’s all you.
Make it look good.
It is!
Let us divide the robot meat amongst us.
You scare me.
Damage detected.
Activating return command.
Roz?
Roz!
No!
Gotcha!
Come on!
Come on!
Guys!
What is happening?
You will be in
reconditions and return to rotation.
But first, we need
everything inside that head of yours.
Why?
You’ve changed.
The data you’ve amassed while on this
island is priceless.
The universal dynamics.
Please, I want to keep my memories.
Your memories are what we came for.
Can I keep just one?
No.
Action.
Please, I want to keep my memories.
And I will order just half.
Right from your head.
Roz!
Roz!
Roz?
Roz! What happened was not your fault.
But what you did to try
and fix it is everything.
I love you.
Mom.
I love you too.
Roz?
Roz?
Let’s go home.
The large, rotten unit is keeping me.
Impossible.
Where are we going?
Only one animal is bigger to stop this.
Padraig, you got a minute.
Uh, we have suddenly taken
an interest in your project.
Male bovine excrement.
You’re in trouble and you need my tree.
Yes, yes we do.
Everyone that made fun of me and mocked
my project admit you a wrong.
Oh, we’re so sorry.
Now you.
I already did.
Now say I’m cool and don’t lie.
Roz!
Stay quiet.
Universal Dynamics cannot afford their
rosums going off script.
Modifying their code, forming connections
with things they should not.
Rival has nothing to do with this.
Please, at least let me return him.
Oh, I’m bringing you both back for study.
Neither of you needs to
be in one piece to do that.
We will just keep
coming until we have you.
We will just keep
coming until we have you.
What’s it saying?
Nothing important.
We will just keep
coming until we have you.
Put it on!
I can’t fly!
You don’t need to.
Don’t be afraid.
Don’t, don’t, don’t you need that?
I have everything I need.
All power to exterior.
You call yourselves animals?
Let’s go!
For the island, Roz!
On a scale of one to ten, how would you
rate my performance?
Whatever those things
are, it’s a cover-up, yeah?
They will just keep
coming until they have me.
And we’ll be ready.
We can fight them off as
many times as we need to.
You don’t need to.
What are you saying? You’re leaving?
Yes. To protect all of you, there are
things there that I must put right.
No, they’ll take your
memories. They’ll take you.
Remember when you
talked to me on the ship?
They cut my power, but I still heard you.
Because I was listening with a different part of myself.
Wherever that is, that’s where I keep meeting.
And I promise, they’ll never, ever find it.
But we fought so hard for you to stay.
You did. And you gained far more than just saving me.
You came together as an island.
When I do this, you will all be safe from them. Forever.
Don’t do this.

Two times, a shotgun, both legally registered to the father.
Eight times, a knife from the family’s kitchen.
Once, a hammer from the family’s toolbox.

Longlegs would have to be inside the house to use the shotgun,
the knife, the hammer, but according to physical evidence, he never is.

…and this friend wants me to say, [TENDERLY]
“Happy Birthday, Lee Harker”, [BREATHING WITH HEAVY EMOTION]
And he wants you all to know that he’ll be there…
[BREATHING HARD]
…and you’ll be there, and you’ll be there, [POINTEDLY] and you’ll be there.

[TURNS OFF PLAYBACK]
It goes on like that for a while.
For how long?
24 minutes.
A’ight, everyone out of here.
Browning, Harker, you stay.
Go. You guys go.
[EXHALING]
His luggage was stuffed with notebooks filled with handwriting.
Handwriting that matches the letters found at the scene, and, suffice to say, it’s all heavily Satanic.
Agent Harker, while the Bureau does appreciate your contribution here, it also puts us in an odd position.
So far, there’s no physical evidence that Kobble has ever killed anyone.
I mean, he worships the Devil, that’s for sure, but in the United States of America, he’s allowed to do that.
I’m more concerned about the fact that he knows who you are, Agent Harker.
But he can’t do anything else about that now that we have him.
“And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw a Beast rise up out of the sea, with seven heads and ten horns”.
And on his horns, he wore ten crowns, “and on each head was written the blasphemous name.”
Book of Revelations, isn’t it?
Revelation.
There’s no “S”. It’s singular.
Longlegs isn’t alone.
He has to have someone helping him.
Maybe multiple, but it it has to be someone that the families felt comfortable letting into their house.
Someone they know, or have met before.
Maybe a child, or someone that could pass as a child.
A’ight, Harker, come on.
We got the guy who wrote the letters, and if we do this right, he’ll spend the rest of his life in jail.
But it’s not over.
The triangle isn’t complete, we’re still missing the 13th.
[BROWNING] The 13th is today, Agent Harker.
What are we supposed to do about that?
We can expect his accomplice to kill at least one more family…
And Kobble’s the only one who knows who that is.
[SIGHING DEEPLY]
Kobble where is he now?
[BROWNING] He’s downstairs.
Right under your feet.
[KOBBLE] I’m a friend of a friend.
[LEE’S MOM] What friend?
My friend.
That lives downstairs.
Downstairs?
Downstairs from where?
Everywheres.
You can even call him “Mr. Downstairs”.
[DOOR LOCK BUZZING OPEN]
[HIGHPITCHED WAILING] Oh there she is!
[GASPING IN DELIGHT]
The Almost Birthday Girl.
[GASPING]
Oh…
[CHUCKLING] It’s funny.
The day you decided to go into law enforcement, you were 20.
We had such a big laugh about it.
Although, it was only me who laughed, not she.
Who is the “she” that you’re talking about?
The seventh “she”.
To be given the same choice that they’ve all been given.
Crimson or clover.
Accept the gift, and destroy it, and destroy yourself, and your selves, or keep it, and bow down.
Bow all the way down…
And get right down to the dirty, dirty work.
Work that gets dirty as it cleans.
Like a mop.
Like a ra… ag.
But you don’t work alone, do you?
Someone’s been helping you.
An accomplice.
Knockknock, on the farmhouse door.
A nice lady with a Bible and a, “Congratulations!
You have been selected.
You may now collect your gift from the church.”
It says it right here, right here on the orders.
On the orders from the man downstairs.
The Camera family farmhouse will be so bright and white, you can’t miss it!
Are you referring to Carrie Anne Camera?
What did you say to her at the mental institution?
Oh, but, Lee, your house was even whiter when I came to visit.
January 13th, 1974, right?
House Number Eight was so white.
Whiter than a fish’s throat.
Whiter than tits.
I knew then that the work we were doing was immaculate.
But your work’s over.
It’s done, and you’re gonna be in here for the rest of your life.
Yes.
I am done…
But I won’t only be in here.
I’ll be a little bit of everywhere.
Waiting in the wings.
In the father’s wings.
Who’s been helping you?
Well…
I’ll let you get started now.
Who is the man downstairs?
Why don’t you ask your mommy?
My mother doesn’t know anything.
Hail Satan.
[SLAMMING]
[GASPING]
[SLAMMING AND CRUNCHING, LEE GASPING]
[CHOKING]
Stop!
[GASPING AND WHEEZING]
[THUD]
[LEE BREATHING SHAKILY]
[CARTER, VOICE MUFFLED] That’s it, Harker.
That’s more than enough.
We had the guy, and now we got nothin’.
We let all those families die, and nothin’ about
any of that is better, or okay, but it’s done!
Oh, and as for the 13th while you were in there,
Carrie Anne Camera jumped off the roof at Water Rock.
Yeah. He must have told her to do that when he saw her.
Just like he somehow told all the others to do what he wanted,
but he did it alone, with no accomplices!
No black magic, no voodoo, no nothing!
You didn’t have to come with me.
I wasn’t gonna let you drive after what you saw today.
How do you wanna do this?
I should go in alone.
I’ll tell her we need to bring her in for questioning.
That we think she could help us identify the accomplice.
All right.
I’ll stay right here.
Mom?
[CHILLING MUSIC SURGING]
Mom?
[CRACK OF A GUNSHOT OUTSIDE]
[SHOT BLASTS]
[GASPING]
[PANTING]
[PANTING]
Mom!
Put the gun down!
What is that thing?
You caught him.
Now he’s free.
You mean Kobble?
But… But Kobble’s de… he’s gone.
Kobble’s dead.
It’s okay, Mom.
It’s…
It’s okay.
It’s it’s done now.
And you’re free, too, baby girl.
[SHOT BLASTING]
[HIGHPITCHED RINGING]
[LEE’S MOM] Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lee.
She lived in a little house with her mother…
And no one ever came to visit them.
No family.
No big, bad wolves.
No anyone.
One day, a man did come…
[KOBBLE, DISTANTLY] Cuckoo!
[LEE’S MOM] …a doll maker.
Just dropping off an early birthday gift, a gift from the church.
[SOBBING IN EXCITEMENT] You’ve won!
[LEE’S MOM] The doll maker started his work…
His terrible magic.
The work of the Devil…
With a little bit of him in every one.
The doll made the little girl forget,
and told her where to look, and what not to see.
The Devil wanted the little girl for his own,
but her mother could never let that happen.
[MUFFLED SCREAMING]
[KOBBLE] You could’ve made nice with me, but you didn’t…, [MUFFLED CRIES]
And now that has led to all of this.
[DISCORDANT MUSIC PULSE]
[MUFFLED SOBBING]
[LEE’S MOM] So her mother begged for the little girl’s life to be spared.
In exchange, she would have to help him.
[HISSING AND SNARLING]
She had once been a nurse.
Now her work would be murdering families…
And so it went like this…
Knockknockknock, on the farmhouse door.
A nice lady with a Bible,
“and a” Congratulations, you’ve won!
A gift from the church.
All her mother had to do was get it inside…
And from his hiding place within the dolls, the Devil did the rest.
All her mother had to do was watch…
And make sure it happened the way he wanted it to.
That was the deal that she made.

[wind blowing]
[birds chirping]
[Sarah] Right here? – [Rodney] Yep.
[Sarah] Okay.
[Sarah chuckles] I’ve never done this before. What do I do?
[Rodney chuckling] Just be yourself.
Try and forget that there’s a camera here.
[Sarah] Okay.
[Rodney] Tell me about yourself. Where are you from?
Texas.
Texas? Really?
What brings you to Wyoming?
[Sarah] My boyfriend and I wanted to, uh…
Well, ex-boyfriend.
We wanted to see all 50 states, like, to say that we had seen all of the states before, um…
[exhales] Um…
Shit.
I’m so sorry.
[Rodney] Hey.
You don’t need to apologize.
It’s so embarrassing.
No, it’s not.




[sniffles]
Hey, look at me.
[sniffles]
You’re beautiful, okay? It’s fine.
Just keep talking. Okay?
So, yeah, we…
We wanted to have this big adventure… before the baby came.
So… that was the plan. [chuckles and sniffles]
Then…
And then he just left.
And I… I…
[camera shutter clicking]
And I don’t know if it was me or if he just…
he just didn’t want to be a dad.
Have you told your family?
No.
No, my mom, she never liked him, and I…
I don’t want to hear “I told you so.”
[sighs]
Uh, I’m… I’m terrified.
Like, I knew he was risky,
but, like… fuck it.
Everyone’s risky.
I don’t know.
I’m so sorry.




I’m just blah, you know? I just…
I haven’t really had a chance to talk to anyone about it yet and I, um…
I really needed that. Thank you.
[chuckles nervously]
What the fuck?
[breathes deeply]
[Rodney grunting]
[Sarah yelling]
[Sarah screaming]
[Sarah choking]
[Rodney grunting]
[Rodney panting]
[coughing]
[Sarah whimpering]
[screaming]
[man 1] It’s just not quite right.
[man 2] Yeah, I don’t feel sorry for her.
She’s not sympathetic. – [man 1] Because she seems angry.
That’s it. She seems angry.
Mmm-hmm.
What about her look?
Eh, it’s okay.
She kinda looks like that one girl in that thing.
From the, uh…
The movie about the junkies in Central Park.




Yes. I hated it. Did you like it?
[softly] No.
Bad. It was bad.
It was horrible.
[sighs]
Did you want me to try it again or…
No, that was great.
{\an8}It says here that you did your BFA in acting at Columbia.
Yeah.
I have a friend who went through that program.
It’s a great program. Yeah.
What year did you graduate?
Hmm?
You might know each other.
I might. What’s his name?
Hmm.
Kevin Wetmore.
Mmm. He might have been before me.
Mmm-hmm. How do you know he wasn’t after you?
Hmm.
[all chuckle]
And you’re okay with nudity, right?
Uh, no, um, it’s just not for me.
Oh, no, I’m… I’m sure they’re fine.
Mmm.




All right. Well, we’ll be in touch.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm.
Okay. Um…
Well, great. Thank you guys so much.
Yes.
Thank you.
Um…
Have a great rest of your day. Always nice to see you.
Like as well.
You too.
Thanks.
Okay. Sheryl.
Yeah?
No.
No.
Uh… Oh, Janet.
Janet.
Janet.
[Sheryl] And I really appreciate that you keep inviting me to audition.
I would just love it so much
if you could look up from the table when I’m reading the scene.
That would just… Just really make my day.
[“I Don’t Mind Doin’ It” playing on car stereo]
[yells]
[music stops]
Okay.
[Terry] It’s a big deal.
Network execs don’t always give actors direct notes,
but that’s the best part.
This one pulls me over, he says, “Your face.”
“Something about your face has a lot of character.”
Which is great. Which means if I test well,
they’ll make me a recurring cast member.
Not every single episode, but, you know, it’s…
Hey, how’s it going?
Hi.
How’d it go?
Um… Yeah, not… I don’t…
[chuckles] Not that great.
What? You’re kidding.
Yeah.
I know. I know. I made you run all those lines with me again for nothing.
No, acting is never wasted time.
[phone ringing]
I was acting, you were acting. Actors act.
Well, that’s very sweet, Terry.
No. I’m being real.
All right. I’m not being sweet, I’m being sincere.
That choice you made when you started whispering
when you were talking about your mom? It gave me goosebumps.




It sounds like your thing went well, huh?
I don’t want to talk… Yes. I mean, it went very well.
[Sheryl] I wanna hear all about it.
You’re just so good. I don’t know how you’re not booking anything.
Hello?
[woman] Hi, Sheryl, I have Helen for you.
Terry. I just need one second.
Oh, yeah, no problem.
[Helen] Hey, sorry I missed your call.
Mmm-hmm.
I had a client walk off set.
Yeah.
The director fired a gun. It’s just chaos.
Oh, wow. That’s, um…
No, that sounds crazy.
No, I just walked in the door. Did they call already?
They loved you.
No, I really don’t think they did.
Well, they thought you weren’t quite right for this one.
So good. They said you seemed a little too…
Yeah, I’m auditioning in a couple weeks I think.
They just weren’t sure that you were passionate about the project.
I mean, I am trying, but sure, yeah.
I feel like we’ve been getting that feedback a lot lately.
Are you still working with that acting coach? Can we find you a…
Um… Look, Helen? Yeah? Yeah.
Um…
I think I can maybe just beat you to the punch a little bit here.
Yeah, I’m rambling. You go ahead.
Mmm-hmm.
I’m working really hard and I’m accomplishing very little, so…
I’m not really sure what I’m doing in L.A. anymore.
Oh, lots of people go through that.
Right.
Helen, I can barely afford my rent.
Hold that thought. Robin, hand me that.
Thank you. Sheryl? Honey?
Yeah?
Okay, sweetie, you know the ABC Studios where they shoot all those…
Mmm-hmm.
You know the one.
The stages in the Valley. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I booked you a guest spot on a TV show.
Wait, really? Yep. Yeah, you bet. Friday.
Right, but I didn’t audition.
You didn’t have to.
I sent them your resume, they think you’re perfect.
Um… What’s the show?
Bachelor number three,
if I were an ice cream sundae,




what flavor would you want me to be and how would you eat me?
If you were my ex-wife, I’d have to say Rocky Road.
[audience laughing]
[audience applauding]
Um… I need a drink.
[man] I’m a vanilla man myself.
Yeah.
I didn’t think I’d come out here and be famous. I just…
I thought if I was disciplined, and I have been…
Yeah, you’re locked in your apartment running lines.
I can hear you most of the time.
I have notes.
[both chuckle]
I have a few notes.
I haven’t even been on a date in two years
’cause I didn’t want the distraction.
And now the…
I don’t know. Helen…
Helen says it’s good because it’ll get me seen,
and Sally Field was on the show, so she’s not totally wrong.
But still, it just feels…
Beneath you?
You think I’m being a brat.
No, it’s beneath you, but I still think it’s a good thing.
The show?
No shit.
Why?
Because you’re gonna meet some cheese ball guy
who you’ll spend all of two minutes with and you’ll hate,
and then you’ll be back here.
Right here at the bar laughing about it with me.
Why will I hate him?
‘Cause he’s gonna be a dork.
[laughs]
And you’d rather be hanging out with me.
Yes, obviously.
Obviously.
I mean, you’re basically my only friend out here.
Well…
And that’s good.
All right, shall we? Another?
Uh, no, I probably shouldn’t. I, you know…
got my big break coming up, so…
I don’t want to look like garbage for that.
You could never look like garbage.
You always look beautiful.
That’s sweet. [chuckles]
Oh, my God. Sorry. [laughs]
That just took me by surprise. Um…
No, that just tickled for, um…
That just took me by surprise.
Sorry, I’m… I…
I think I’m a little jumpy. I had a weird… Pretty weird day.
[chuckles awkwardly]
Yeah, no, I…
I get it.
Okay, great.
Do you want to leave?
No. Um…
No, we should have another one.
[Sheryl sighs]
[officer] Wake up.
Can’t stay here.
Pack it up.
Yeah, okay.
Let’s keep it moving.
[radio playing indistinctly]
[soft music playing]
[man] Hey.
You need to keep this aisle clear.
You can’t just sleep here.
Unbelievable.

I look pretty fucking far from beautiful right now.
What are you talking about? You look gorgeous.

I don’t know who that is.

Well, consider me fucking swooned.
So you ever done any modeling before?
Dude, I’m broke as shit. So whatever you’re trying to sell me…
I’m not trying to sell you anything. I’m serious.
There’s this photo contest that I want to enter.
I’ve been looking for a subject.
I think you’d be perfect for it.
Hold that pose.
Hold what pose?

Now look over your left shoulder.
That’s your right. Your other left.

There you go. Now look right into the lens right here

Come on. There she is. [laughs]
Look at you. One more.
You know, Farrah Fawcett, she’s got nothing on you.
So what do you say?
[chuckles softly]
Lisa.
[Lisa] Sheryl.
Hi. I’m so sorry I’m late.
No, it’s fine.
[Sheryl] There was an accident on the 101 and…
Do you need anything? I can get you coffee, water?
Uh, no, thank you.
Have you eaten? I can get you a bagel.
No, really, I’m fine.
Helen tells me you’re from Pennsylvania.
Um, Allentown, yeah.
[Lisa] Oh, I went to Penn State.
Oh, uh…
Go Lady Lions.
[chuckles]
Can I get you a water?
You asked me that already.
Okay, right through here.
Great.
[Lisa] Great.
[Lisa sighs]
So you excited about this? How you feeling?
Um, good. Yeah, I think it’ll be fun.
It’ll be so fun. I promise. We’ll get you through hair and makeup.
I saw your bachelors backstage. You got a good batch.
Oh, really? What are they like?
[Marilyn] They’re idiots, all of them.
I don’t know where they get ’em from.
From under a rock.
Right?
Do you remember that one guy that we had on the show? Um, filmmaker.
[woman] Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, my God.
He was beautiful,
but I’m telling you, the IQ of a lug nut.
Oh, it was really too bad.
You want some?
No. I’m…
So he shows up with his identical twin brother
and he says, “Oh, I’m making a movie.”
“We’re both acting in it.”
“I’m the star, but he’s playing my best friend.”
[soft music playing]
[laughs]
His identical twin brother is playing his best friend.
What the hell is that?
Brilliant.
I love it.
Oh, God.
Is it possible to get a guy in this town that isn’t a maniac?
[woman] Or a total moron.
Hello. Hey, how’s everybody doing?
Whoa, a room full of beautiful women.
Put that skunk weed away. You’re going to get me in trouble.
What’s up, Marilyn? So this is Sheryl.
Yeah, hi.
They told me that you went to Juilliard.
No.
Well, that’s fantastic.
So I guess you’re a real music freak? Do you like the sound of this?
Yeah, it’s cool.
There you go. See?
Women love that Black sound.
Come on, whatever happened to Tony Bennett?
Whatever happened to Bing Crosby?
I mean, if you want soul, listen to Perry Como singing “Moonglow.”
Hey, can you do me a favor?
Yeah.
Okay. You’re an intelligent girl, anyone can see that.
But when you get on that stage,
I don’t want you to play so smart, all right?
The guys are getting intimidated.
You know boys, they’re babies.
Right.
You know? That’s right.
I just need you to laugh and smile just over and over.
Can you do that for me?
Sure.
I’d appreciate it.
Of course.
There you go. You have a beautiful smile.
Mr. Burke, your wife’s on the phone.
Yeah?
Okay, thanks. Is this… Is this the dress you’re wearing?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Bruce. Hey, Bruce, can you hear me?
[Bruce] Yes.
Yeah,
can we get her in something a little more flattering?
She’s got the body, so let’s use it.
All right. Thank you so much.
[woman] Looks perfect.
[Lisa] The audience is filling up. Everyone’s getting excited.
Great.
[woman] Looks great. Actually, know what?
Maybe we should try the updo.
Yeah, whatever you want.
Yeah?
[Marilyn] I like it down.
[woman] You like it down? Okay, let’s do down.
Great.
[woman] Nice and flowing. Fabulous.
[indistinct chatter]
[woman] Careful. Smooth it out. Watch the car.
[Ken] Relax, Mom, it’s fine.
This is it?
It doesn’t look like a television studio.
Mom, how would you know? You’ve never seen one.
Hey, don’t talk back to your mother.
Just looks so drab.
What you see on TV, all these lights and stages.
There’s lights inside, I promise.
Doesn’t it look drab?
Should we grab the umbrellas? It’s gonna rain.
Gonna rain? Come on. Let’s hurry it up.
How are you holding up?
I don’t know.
I’m feeling a little drab.
On TV, they have all those big lights and stages.
Yeah, yeah.
So what do you think?
It’s great.
Awesome.
We’re ready for you.
Okay.
[man 1] All right, everybody. Let’s get started.
[man 2] Fine to start without the live feed.
[audience cheering and applauding]
[man 2] It’s fine. Good to go.
[man 3] Ed’s ready backstage.
[announcer] Live from the Chuck Barris Stages in Hollywood, California,
it’s The Dating Game. And now your host, Ed Burke.
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much.
You’re too kind.
Welcome back to The Dating Game.
I’m your host Ed Burke,
and we’re absolutely thrilled you’re all joining us tonight.
{\an8}And who knows? Will today be the day that sparks fly?
All right, Ed’s just doing his intro now.
As soon as he’s done…
Wait, he’s on right now?
Mmm-hmm. Okay, oh, just watch your step here.
Be careful.
Sorry.
[Ed] Now, this is a program…
[Lisa] Okay, right over here now. Stop, stop.
[Ed]…and one very pretty girl.
[applause]
Okay.
[Ed] We give her a chance to question
the gentlemen…
Okay, now you’re just around here.
Up these steps.
Okay. Great.
And then what, I’m just on?
Mmm-hmm. You okay?
Uh-huh.
Great. Have fun.
{\an8}[Ed]…show you how we play the game. Come with me.
{\an8}Before we meet our three eligible bachelors,
I think we should meet our lovely bachelorette.
I had the chance to meet her backstage and she is ready for a connection.
[whispering] Sally Field. Sally Field. Sally Field.
[Ed] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the woman of the hour, Sheryl!
Shit.
[upbeat music playing]
[audience applauding]
[breathing heavily]
[Charlie] I gotta get out of here.
Somewhere I can see the sky.
[sighs]
Yeah, I can’t wait.
No, the place is great. It’s coming together.
{\an8}I’m still seeing you this weekend, right?
[chuckles]
Yeah, well, you better, ’cause you’re in the doghouse now.
[chuckles]
Shit.
[humming]
[doorbell buzzes]
[door continues buzzing]
[Charlie singing indistinctly]
[vehicle doors closing]
Shit.
Sorry. Coming.
Coming.
Hey, hey.
Hey, is this for 2-A?
[man] It is.
‘Kay, great. Here, I’ll let you in.
We’ve been ringing the apartment for ten minutes.
Sorry, I was in the shower. I didn’t hear it.
Tommy, let’s go.
What?
You’re just gonna leave it all out here?
[man] Wish we could help, but we have a schedule to keep.
[engine starts]
Hey, Ansel Adams.
It’s, like, the last thing.
Yeah. It better be.
[laughs] Yeah. I think it is.
Okay. Almost. Okay.
[sighs] You want a beer?
You’ve never heard of Roman Polanski?
He’s the doorman at the Ice Palace?
No, no, no. No.
Big guy with the tattoos?
No. He’s the short guy
who directed Repulsion and Rosemary’s Baby.
Are those movies or…
You’re killing me.
I’m trying to name-drop here.
Drop away, man.
No, because you don’t know who I’m talking about
so it’s not as impressive.
[laughs]
You’re fucking with me.
Have I seen Rosemary’s Baby? Come on.
What? I don’t know. Maybe you don’t like scary movies.
I don’t like scary movies, but I’ve seen Rosemary’s-fucking-Baby.
Okay, so I took a class with him at NYU, all right?
With Roman Polanski, I mean. And that’s it.
That’s all I wanted to say.
Very impressive.
Do you feel better now?
[exhales]
[laughs softly]
You still go there?
I just graduated.
Congratulations. That’s amazing.
So what now?
I’m off to New Hampshire, actually.
Yeah. I’m gonna be teaching kids photography.
Very cool.
Yeah.
You know, it’s crazy.
It’s my last day here,
and I meet you. [chuckles]
Like, it’s so hard to meet people, you know, that you can connect with, so…
when I do I just… I like to savor the moment, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I’m… I’m the same way.
Hey, so I should probably get this shit together.
I mean, this place is a mess. I have to get unpacking.
It’s, like, such a disaster. I don’t know where anything is gonna go,
it’s, ugh, a bit insane.
But thank you so much for your help.
It was very, very, very useful, so…
So, you said you were a stewardess?
[Charlie] Uh, yeah.
Well, what’s that like?
Well, I get to get groped by sweaty businessman
while putting things in the overhead,
so what’s not to love?
But, no, it is great.
I mean, I get to see the world and travel for free and…
I mean, I get to go to Egypt next week.
I’ve always wanted to go to Egypt, so I’m very excited.
I think at first I was afraid that I was gonna get lonely
being away from home, but my airline is amazing…
Can I take your picture?
[traffic bustling]
[glass breaking]
[Charlie grunting]
[Charlie screaming]
[Rodney grunting]
[coughing]
[panting]
[choking]
[camera shutter clicks]
There she is. What a beauty.
Come on down here, darling.
There we go. You just stand right there for me.
Sheryl is an aspiring actress from Scranton, Pennsylvania.
She used to work massaging feet,
but quit when her boss asked her to work her way up.
She moved here from L.A. after graduating college
and now is hoping to find a Romeo to complement her Juliet.
My goodness, you are a beauty. What a knockout. How you doing?
Uh, doing well.
Okay. Fantastic.
Are you ready to get this party started?
Yeah.
Okay, well, let the games begin.
[cheering and applause]
The rules of the game are simple.
There are three bachelors behind this partition.
You can ask them whatever you like except for their name, age or occupation.
At the end, you pick which one you’d like to go out with.
Sound good?
Great.
[director] “A” camera, get ready for the snap zoom.
Hi, Sheryl, pleased to make your pleasure.
No, I mean, pleasure to meet your, um…
Save that talk for the date.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
There we go. Third time’s a charm. Bachelor number two?
Hello, Sheryl.
Hello, hello, hello.
If you want to groove, pick number two.
[Sheryl] Oh, my God, is he stuck like that?
[Ed] We’ll have to find out.
And would you please say hello to Sheryl, bachelor number three?
[director] Lights up on number three.
We’re gonna have a great time together, Sheryl.
[audience exclaiming, laughing]
[Ed] He’s confident.
Now you know what they sound like, are you ready to take the next step?
I think I am.
Do you have your question set?
Sure do.
Let’s take a seat and make yourself comfortable.
And here we go.
[cheering and applause]
[upbeat music playing]
[director] Oh, Jesus, Ed. Okay, cue the “applause” sign.
[applause stops]
Bachelor number one,
we’re in a drama class and it’s the big audition.
You’re a nerdy schoolboy asking me out on a date.
Take it away.
[woman] Ooh!
Uh…
Hey, I… I’m a…
You know, I’m a nerdy schoolboy. Do you want to go on a date?
Is that it?
[laughter]
Yeah.
[Ed] Well, we got a genius.
[director] Pan to number two.
I like it, bachelor number one.
Um, bachelor number two, you’re the captain of the football team.
Go.
[Laura gasping]
[bachelor 2] Hey there, Peggy Sue…
Hey, you okay?
[Laura] Yeah, I’m fine.
[bachelor 2] I was thinking if you weren’t doing nothing,
maybe we could play a game of touch football.
I’d be shirts, you’d be skins.
[audience exclaim]
[Sheryl] I don’t know. That sounds awfully rough.
[bachelor 2] Rough and rowdy, that’s the way I like it, babe.
Bachelor number three, you’re the accomplished professor.
Go for it.
Young lady, I’m gonna need you to stay after class
and have a word with me.
[audience exclaiming]
Oh. Do you need to teach me a lesson?
[Rodney] Yes. Yes, I do.
In fact, you’re going to have to bend over…
backwards with dedication.
[laughter]
[applause]
[Sheryl] Okay, um, bachelor number one…
[indistinct chatter, laughter]
[gasps softly]
[Sheryl] If I served you for dinner, what would you be?
[bachelor 1] Uh, I am the buffet.
[laughter]
I gotta get out of here.
Right now? It’s the middle of the show.
Gotta go to the bathroom.
Everything okay?
Look, stop.
Where’s she going?
[Sheryl] Bachelor number two?
Oh, I’m a big old green salad with the vinaigrette on the side,
because I like things undressed.
[audience exclaiming]
Ah, that’s funny.
Bachelor number one…
[all exclaiming]
[gasps]
Jesus, what the fuck was that?
[man 1] Guys, what was that?
[man 2] Was that part of the show?
[man 3] What do we do?
[director] Somebody down there get Ed’s attention.
[man 1] Ed. Say something.
Uh, well, ladies and gentlemen, that is the end of round one,
and I think we’re going to hear from our sponsors.
[microphone feedback whines]
We’ll be right back.
Go to commercial. Go to two.
What the fuck was that?
[man] ‘Kay, everyone, we’re resetting. Someone clean that up.
What the fuck was that?
Oh, baby, you’re doing amazing. Just knocking it out of the park.
Great.
Hey, the magic of television. Huh? [laughs]
We got some time. Who’s here from out of town?
Hollywood, first time? Oh!
Bet you didn’t think it was gonna be that exciting.
[laughter]
Right, just clean this up.
[Lisa] Look, this is not my job. She came from over there.
[hyperventilating]
[crying]
Goddamnit.
[imperceptible]
[yells]
[elevator bell dings]
Um, do you know where…
He’s probably somewhere upstairs holding court.
[Rodney] Yeah, I met her at Warren Beatty’s house.
[man] Warren Beatty’s house. Listen to this fucking guy.
[all laugh]
[Mario] Hey, uh, Rodney?
This is the new guy, Mario, right?
Yeah.
And her parents let you take this?
Let me? [chuckles] They paid me.
No.
I can see it. I think it’d be great. That’s how the industry works.
[man] Yeah, I know how it works.
[indistinct chatter]
She’s just 13.
Yeah, but, I mean, come on.
Girls these days…
You know, I took that one in Malibu a few weeks ago.
Yeah. It’s nice.
You know, I was just thinking maybe going there later today.
I usually find my subject at the beach, but…
You’d look great in that light, so, you know, if you’re around…
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I’m not… I’m not busy.
You’re not busy.
I’m free whenever.
Rod. Rod?
[Rodney] Yeah?
Some people are here to see you.
Yeah, who? Warren Beatty?
[laughter]
It’s the police.
Oh, yeah, no, um, my place, it was jacked last week, so…
Some of the camera equipment was lost.
They’re probably just following up on that, you know?
All right. See you guys later.
[man] Party’s over.
[indistinct chatter]
[Rodney] Well, that’s… That’s your job, right?
It’s not my job.
[indistinct conversation]
[laughter]
Yeah. Yeah, you know, we always gotta check these things out.
[Rodney] You’re just doing your job.
Sorry for the misunderstanding.
It’s okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
[sighs]
[hushed conversation]
[man clears throat]
[breath trembling]
Fuck.
[faucet squeaks]
[water running]
[man coughs]
[zipper closes]
[sniffles]
Hey.
Uh, so, um…
Later, I can’t,
’cause they actually want me to stay late
because I…
There’s like, nobody here. Short on staff.
Um…
Another time?
Yeah.
I’ll find someone else.
Okay.
Sorry.
[door opens, closes]
[Laura] Alison?
[knock on door]
Al, are you in there?
Hey, Al, I’ve been calling for a while and I’m just a little worried about you.
Okay, I’m gonna use the spare.
Now, I’m coming in, okay? If you’re in there, I’m coming in.
[breath trembling]
[indistinct chatter]
[man] Yeah, it’s all good. All good.
Excuse me.
Gotta work in here.
What’d I tell you? Lug nuts.
How am I doing?
You’re great. Fabulous.
What is it? What’s the matter?
[Sheryl] Oh, nothing. Nothing.
I’m trying to do what Ed said. Just feels a little weird. That’s all.
Oh, fuck Ed.
No disrespect, but fuck him.
This isn’t a sitcom, you’re not coming back next week.
[Ed speaking indistinctly]
What’s Ed gonna do? Fire you?
[chuckles]
You’re supposed to be having fun. That’s the whole point.
So just be yourself. Say whatever you want.
[indistinct chatter]
Do either of you have a pen?
[woman] Yeah, here you go.
Thank you.
[Marilyn] She looks fine.
Yeah, she’s gorgeous.
Yeah.
[Marilyn] Yeah. Look at these guys.
Thank you.
Don’t mind if I do.
No, thanks.
[sighs] Too small.
Seriously, anything under a C cup, can’t do it.
What about her?
What about her?
You haven’t seen her yet. What if she’s petite?
I’ll let her blow me. [chuckles]
No, you won’t.
I won’t? And why is that?
Because I always get the girl.
[scoffs]
[director] You guys all set down there?
Check in with Matthew to see how close we are.
[man] He says he just needs 30 seconds.
[director] “B” camera, come on. We’re up and running.
[bell rings]
In place, everyone.
Ladies, stop messing with her hair. I know you’re barely touching her.
We’re ready for you.
Don’t let that throw you. You got this.
Okay, Mr. Burke.
Hey, you guys good? You need anything? Okay, great.
We’re on.
[Ken] Laura. Are you okay?
Hey.
I know bachelor number three.
Oh.
Did you date him or something?
No, I didn’t date him. I… He…
[exhales]
Do you remember my friend Alison, the one who was…
Yeah. I remember you talking about her.
And there was that guy at the beach and…
I shouldn’t have left her there. I…
[crying]
I told her to be careful, and I knew that there was something wrong.
I knew something was off about that guy.
You gave his description to the police.
Yeah. That’s the guy.
Bachelor number three?
Um…
How sure are you?
I’m pretty sure.
Pretty sure?
Like 90%.
But you’re not positive.
I’m just saying this guy might look really similar, right?
I’m not saying that I don’t believe you, Laura.
I mean, if this guy did what you’re implying, then…
wouldn’t he be in jail and not on a TV show?
I don’t know. I…
It’s a big TV show.
You don’t think they vet their contestants?
I…
Maybe it is the guy, right?
And maybe the police, they looked into him and they cleared him.
Look, I love you.
And I’m really sorry that you lost your friend.
It must feel like he’s around every corner.
I can’t even imagine, but…
I’m just not sure what you want me to do.
Get out.
What?
Get out.
Laura…
Now!
[exhales]
Okay, everyone. Here we go. Look alive.
[bell rings]
We’re back into it in five, four, three, two…
[upbeat music playing]
[applause]
[Ed] All right. Welcome back to The Dating Game.
Thank you for bearing through that, uh, technical difficulty.
Back to the show. Sheryl, the floor is yours. Take it away.
Bachelor number one,
Einstein said that sitting on a hot stove for a minute feels like an hour,
but sitting next to a nice girl for an hour feels like a minute.
That was his theory of special relativity. What’s yours?
Um…
What?
[laughter]
I’ll come back to you.
Wait. Was that the actual question?
Bachelor number two, when you invite a girl out for dinner,
what do you expect in return?
Ooh.
[bachelor 2] Uh…
I guess that depends on the meal. Are we talking filet mignon, or what?
That’s a good question, are we?
[bachelor 2] Yeah. Sure. I’m a generous guy.
Good to know.
[man] Are these the scripted questions?
Since I’m spending an arm and a leg on dinner,
I’d like to think that she could at least provide the dessert.
Oh, and what would you order for dessert?
Oh, you know.
No, I don’t. Tell me.
[laughter]
[bachelor 2] Something hot.
Like cherries flambé?
Yeah, with lots of whipped cream.
Sorry, I’m on a diet.
Bachelor number one, how’s that theory of special relativity coming along?
Hmm?
Groovy, keep at it.
Bachelor number three,
what’s the difference between a boy and a man?
A boy thinks that buying a woman dinner means she owes him something.
Okay, and what does a man think?
Well, for starters,
he knows better than to start talking about dessert
before he’s made it through dinner.
[audience applauding]
[Sheryl] That’s not bad.
Bachelor number one, any luck?
[man] Keep up, she’s going back to the genius.
[bachelor 1] I can’t.
Okay. Should I be taking notes, teacher, or…
Oh, it will be on the final exam, Ed.
[laughter]
That’s good.
Bachelor number three, your buddy’s drawing a blank.
Want to help him out?
With his theory of special relativity?
Yeah.
Whether it’s for a minute or for an hour,
I’d like to sit relatively close to a special girl
whenever I get the chance.
How’s that?
That’s pretty good. That’s not bad.
[applause]
[laughter and applause]
Bachelor number one, I threw you a curveball last time.
I’ll say. I didn’t know I needed to be an astrologer to be on this show.
Do you mean an astronomer?
Is there a difference?
Do you want there to be?
Um, no.
By the way,
Einstein was a physicist, not an astronomer. Doesn’t matter.
Are you gonna ask me a question?
I just asked you two, but sure.
In the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals,
Immanuel Kant argues…
[man] She’ll give him a heart attack.
I don’t… [scoffs]
I’m kidding. Bachelor number one, I’m kidding.
I’m just having fun with you.
Bachelor number one, this is nice and easy.
What are girls for?
Uh, what do you mean?
[Sheryl] Just what I said. What are girls for?
Jeez, you’re getting edgy with this one.
Oh, want to go back to Immanuel Kant?
No, no, I can do this.
Good to hear it. I believe in you, bachelor number one.
Thank you.
Uh, girls are for…
guys.
And… you know, having fun with.
Well, Gloria Steinem would be proud.
Being a little hard on the boys.
I think we’re all having fun.
Of course.
Aren’t we having fun?
[cheering and applause]
[Sheryl laughs]
See? We’re having so much fun. [chuckles]
Bachelor number two, what are girls for?
Uh… Why does this feel like a trap?
I don’t know. Why does it?
Well, because if I say girls are for wining and dining,
then I sound like a jerk,
and if I say they’re for respecting or whatever,
then I just sound like a schmuck looking to get laid.
Okay, bachelor number two, I think you answered my question.
Hey, wait. No, I didn’t mean it like that.
[Sheryl] Moving on.
Bachelor number three, I’m counting on you.
What are girls for?
[guard] I… No. [chuckles]
No. No one’s beaten Ali twice.
Yeah, I don’t think so.
Uh, Jim, give me a second. Can I help you with something?
Um, I need to speak with someone on The Dating Game.
You want tickets, you need go to guest relations.
Go back down the hallway, take a right.
I don’t want to see the show. I just came from there.
I need to speak with someone who works on it,
like a producer or something.
What for?
There’s someone on the show right now who shouldn’t be there.
Who shouldn’t be there? Your boyfriend?
No.
Husband?
[sighs]
Last year, a friend of mine was raped and murdered,
and the police never…
I think that the guy that killed her is up on that stage right now.
Bachelor number three.
And this is a very dangerous man, so can you just call someone for me?
Please.
Hey, Jim, I’m gonna have to call you back. Yeah.
[Rodney] What are girls for?
[Sheryl] Yeah, that’s right.
Hmm. I guess I’d have to say that that’s up to the girl.
[applause]
That’s a very good answer.
Oh, yeah, we love that.
Um…
Bachelor number three, I have a follow-up question.
Shoot.
You’ve been with the other bachelors for a while now.
We’ve talked for a bit, yeah.
Okay. Tell me, what’s the most disgusting thing
bachelors one and two have said or done backstage?
Besides coming on this show, of course.
That’s good.
[Rodney] Oh, gosh. Um…
That’s a tough one. If I’m being honest,
bachelor number one didn’t really say anything disgusting.
That’s, uh… That’s true. I didn’t.
[laughter]
And what about bachelor number two?
Um, I can’t repeat it word for word as how we’re on television and all, but…
he had some thoughts about bra sizes
being a prerequisite for a meaningful relationship.
Oh. Is that right?
Oh, darn it, that signals the end of our game.
[upbeat music playing]
Sheryl, it’s time to make a decision.
Why don’t you sit right there, analyze what you heard?
We’re going to take a little time for you
to make a decision about the very fine products…
You can wait in the office here. Someone will be with you shortly.
[Laura] Who?
George Elliot. Series producer.
You can have a seat if you like.
He’ll be able to help you. Good luck.
Thank you.
Really.
[door opens]
[Ed] And we’ll be right back.
[director] And we’re out.
[bell ringing]
After the show, I want this cunt out of here.
I never want to see her again.
I know. I’m so sorry, sir.
[woman] So who you gonna pick?
Oh, knock it off.
What? I’m just asking.
Do you think I went too far?
[chuckles] I think he thinks you went too far.
[woman] He thinks everything is too far.
[Marilyn chuckles]
Yeah, but do you, though?
Honey, I’ve been on the show since 1968
and I’ve seen more idiots flirting back and forth than I can count.
The one thing I’ve learned is no matter what words they use,
the question beneath the question remains the same.
All right. What’s the question?
Which one of you will hurt me?
You just asked it clearer than most.
Hey, man, what the fuck?
Why would you tell her that?
She asked.
Fuck you.
You know what? Soon as this show’s over, you and me, we’re gonna have words.
Is that right?
Well, what if I don’t show?
You gonna hire somebody to track me down?
[scoffs] Fucking pussy.
You know what? I have a better idea.
Why don’t we swap contact information so we know where to find each other?
Okay. Yeah.
Stocker Street, Glendale. Yeah, I know where that is.
Here.
Jesus, what the fuck is that, man?
[chuckles]
It’s fake.
[exhales sharply]
You fucking weirdo.
Yeah.
[door opens]
[man] All right, folks, everyone in place.
[bell rings]
[indistinct chatter]
That’s enough. Let’s get out of here.
Let’s move this chair. Get up, Sheryl.
We’ve had an entire commercial break to get rid of this. Come on. Go.
Here, right there.
[man] And five, four, three, two…
Go, go.
Boys are babies, right?
[scoffs]
[clears throat] Welcome back to The Dating Game.
Sheryl, you have played this game beautifully,
but now it is time to make a decision.
Our bachelors were cool, candid, sharp and, uh, patient,
but only one of them can get the date.
Will it be bachelor number one,
bachelor number two or bachelor number three?
Sheryl, who is the lucky guy?
Number three.
Number three.
My, my, my. Let me ask you, Sheryl,
what about number three appealed to you the most?
He knows what girls are for.
[Ed] He knows what girls are for.
Before we meet bachelor number three,
let me introduce you to bachelor number one.
From Sherman Oaks,
he is a medical intern and desires to own his own practice.
His hobbies include reading and golf.
Please welcome Josh Young.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Wonderful job. Marvelous job.
Bachelor number two is a furniture designer from Glendale
who enjoys Frisbee and dancing.
Sheryl, please meet Arnie Aslan.
[audience applauding]
[Arnie] Careful with that asshole.
[Ed] Thank you, gentlemen.
We have some very fine parting gifts for you right out this way.
It is time to come face to face with the bachelor you did choose,
but, first, I’d like to tell you a little bit about him.
Bachelor number three hails from the great state of Texas.
He’s a skydiver, into motorcycling, and is a fine photographer.
Please welcome Rodney Alcala.
[cheering and applause]
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
So nice to meet you.
[Ed] Well, you did it, Rodney.
You offered some great answers to some very tricky questions
and you got the girl.
Thanks, Ed.
[Ed] Rodney and Sheryl, pack your bags,
you’re going on an all-expense paid trip to Carmel, California.
Thanks for joining us.
We’ll see you next time on The Dating Game.
[man] And we’re out.
[man] Great job, sir. Follow me.
[Lisa] Sheryl, sweetie?
This way. Watch your step here. Just go through this door. Thank you.
[vacuum cleaner whirring]
Excuse me?
Hi, I’m sorry to bother you. Um…
I’m supposed to meet with someone named George Elliot. He’s a producer.
I beg your pardon?
George Elliot. He’s an executive producer on The Dating Game.
Do you know where I could find him?
It’s very important that I speak with him.
I doubt that very much.
Why?
Because I’m George Elliot.
What?
Let me guess.
Security guard out front, he set this up, yeah?
He is a real asshole, all right.
Excuse me.
If there’s something I can do, I’d be happy to try and…
Thank you so much again. Did you have fun?
Yeah, I had a lot of fun.
Okay, right this way.
This way? Got it.
Just around this corner here.
I thought it went really well.
I think so too.
Now, safe travels. We’ll be in touch.
Thank you so much. [chuckles]
Sheryl?
Hi. Hey.
I lost you back there.
Yeah, I looked for you after I changed, but that was crazy.
The whole thing was crazy.
[both chuckling]
They shoved me on stage, the lights went on and here we go.
Yeah. Yeah.
It was kind of fun.
I mean, it was evil and soul-crushing, but… I had a little fun.
Yeah.
But, yeah, uh, I guess I’ll see you in Carmel.
[Rodney chuckles]
I mean, do you wanna go somewhere now?
[Amy] No fucking way.
This is beautiful.
[Rodney] Hey.
You want some?
Hell yeah.
Man, who would have thought that I’d found the love of my life today?
[coughing] Don’t make me fucking laugh, you asshole.
Take it easy.
Is that your stuff?
Yeah, that’s some of my work.
Let’s see what I’m working with.
Wow.
These are, um…
I won 500 with that one.
No shit.
Yep.
All right, well, enough of this crap.
Why don’t you spill it out? Where are you from?
Why do you want to know?
Why are you not telling me?
Maybe because I didn’t fucking like it there.
Ah, okay.
So you’re a runaway.
Oh, my God.
You make me sound like I’m Oliver-fucking-Twist.
I’m independent.
Your folks, they must be worried.
Tammy’s too loaded to worry about anything.
What about your dad? Where’s he at?
Who knows?
He took off when I was a kid.
That must have been tough.
You know, growing up without him.
Oh, please.
When did your dad walk out on you?
Did you make it to eighth grade?
Did you ever try to find him?
[scoffs]
No. I’m afraid I’d kill him.
It’s amazing how one selfish asshole can fuck up your entire life.
Here.
What is this?
It’s chocolate.
What’s it for?
It’s Valentine’s Day.
You’re my valentine.
That looks pretty far.
It’s not. It’s just up that hill.
Hill?
You wearing comfortable shoes?
Yeah.
Good, ’cause you’ll need ’em.
You ready?
Yeah.
All right, follow me.
Almost there.
Sun’s going down too.
[Amy] Where do you want me to stand?
[Rodney] Just keep going that way, by the rock.
[Amy] This one?
[Rodney] Just keep going.
Yeah, right by the edge.
There, that’s nice.
[camera shutter clicking]
Now turn around, face the light.
Yeah, that’s beautiful.
You’re a natural.
All right, just one more.
Now look up straight to the sky.
Did you get the shot?
Rodney?
[glass breaks]
Oh, my God, where are we? What is this place?
[laughs]
I don’t know,
but this is what happens when a pretty girl like yourself
tells me to duck into the first place I find.
Oh, my God.
I thought it looked normal from the outside.
What are you reading?
Oh, uh…
Uh, Cowboy Mouth. It’s this play.
Sam Shepard, Patti Smith.
Yeah.
I saw the… The original run.
Really? So you lived in New York.
Yeah, NYU.
Columbia.
Mmm.
I probably passed you on the subway.
Mmm. I think I would remember you.
Um…
Sometimes it’s necessary to go a long distance out of the way
in order to come back a short distance correctly.
Is that Cowboy Mouth or…
Oh, no, The Zoo Story.
Ah, that’s right. Oh, my God.
It’s such a beautiful piece.
You know it?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, Albee’s an incredible writer.
He is. He’s, um… He’s a genius.
You know, he’s actually… It’s one of my favorites.
Wow, you know your stuff.
Um…
Anyway, there’s a production of Cowboy Mouth
that’s going up at the Odyssey, so I’m auditioning in, like, a week.
Cool.
Well, I can’t wait to see you in that.
[chuckles softly]
Yeah, I don’t have the part yet.
It’s in the bag.
Oh, yeah, you think so?
Yeah, for sure.
I mean you have this Patti Smith vibration thing going on.
[Sheryl chuckles]
That’s sweet. I could not have less of a Patti Smith vibration going on.
[chuckles softly] I’m not talking about this.
I’m talking about… soul, you know?
Okay. [chuckles]
That’s very far out. [laughs]
I mean, it’s… I think that’s good.
That’s good. I’m into that.
I’m probably making this harder than it has to be.
I don’t date much. I don’t date at all, actually.
But you decided to go to The Dating Game.
Yeah, that’s funny. Um…
My agent said it would get me seen.
“It’s good exposure. It’ll get you seen.”
[scoffs]
Did you feel seen?
I felt looked at.
How do you feel right now?
Fine.
Fine. [chuckles]
You know, most people don’t like to be seen.
They’re afraid.
Because you have to be comfortable with yourself.
You have to stop performing.
Hmm.
I never hide who I am.
Excuse me, ma’am? Can you give us another round?
We had the mai tais.
Sorry, you missed last call. We’re just closing up.
That’s a shame.
Well, I guess we’ll have to get out of here then, huh?
Yeah.
Parked back at the lot?
Yeah.
I’ll walk with you.
What’s your number?
I figure we have to connect before we go to Carmel, so…
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
Something wrong?
No.
Thanks.
Good night.
Hey.
Can you tell me your number?
I just gave it to you.
Yeah, no, I know, I just…
want to make sure I have the right one.
You know, sometimes the fours, they kind of look like nines.
Right. Um…
Yeah, just let me see it and I…
You can’t repeat it from memory?
So I guess this means we’re not really meeting up in Carmel anymore?
I’m not going anywhere with you.
All right.
Fair enough.
Maybe I’ll see you around.
Yeah, maybe.
[softly] Then you’d get your fucking head bashed in.
What?
[Sheryl breathing heavily]
[softly] Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck.
Get your fucking hand off my car.
[door opens]
[men chattering]
[breathing heavily]
[engine starts]
Fuck.
[bell ringing]
[children chattering, laughing]
[Laura] So great.
Sarah, can you save that for later? Thanks.
Really good. Yeah, try one more.
You ready?
{\an8}[Laura] Yeah, I did.
{\an8}I did file a report in December of last year,
and I don’t know what else to tell… This man, he was on national television.
Look, I don’t know who you spoke with, all right?
I… I don’t know who I spoke with either.
How many… Forget it.
Do your fucking job!
Fuck!
[female officer] Ma’am?
[Laura] Sorry. I’m going.
[Helen] Sheryl, sweetie, I think you’re making a mistake.
[Sheryl] I can appreciate that, Helen.
[Helen] Right now MGM is looking for an unknown brunette
for this big thriller they’ve got,
and they do want to see a swimsuit photo before you can audition…
[Sheryl] I’m not gonna do that.
I’ll see if they can make an exception.
[Sheryl] No, not just this audition, all of it.
[Helen] Don’t be the girl who was on one stupid TV show
and was never seen again. You’re better than that.
[Sheryl chuckles] Yeah, I know.
Listen, I’m really sorry that it didn’t work out
and I appreciate everything, I really do.
Um…
Bye, Helen.
I just, um…
Okay.
This is everything, so we’re good to go.
[wind whistling]
[Rodney crying]
[continues crying]
Hey.
Hey, are you okay?
I guess things got pretty crazy last night.
Do you think that you could do me a favor?
Do you think that you could not tell anyone about this?
Please?
I would just be so fucking embarrassed.
You know how judgmental people can be.
Thank you.
So…
Do you want to go back to your place?
Okay.
Cool.
Can you help me with these?
Someone knows how to tie a knot.
Something tells me you were a Boy Scout.
[Rodney] Hey, um…
I just wanted to say…
I’m sorry if I was rough with you back there.
It’s okay, baby.
Everything’s okay.
[engine starts]
[Rodney breathes deeply]
I’m gonna take a leak. You want something?
I’m okay.
Okay.
[faucet squeaks]
[water running]
[sirens wailing]
[sirens stop]
[car doors closing]
[officers shouting indistinctly]
[officer 1] Don’t move!
[officer 2] Hands where I can see ’em.
[officer 3] Get on the fucking ground!
[handcuffs clicking]
[Rodney grunting]
Tony, call for backup!
Get the cuffs. Hold his legs down.
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Stop resisting.
Don’t do this. Let go.
Dave, get him.
[officer 4] We’re out by mile marker 112. We need assistance immediately.
[officer 3] Okay.
[officer 4] Take a breath.
[officer 2] He’s… He’s done.

BASED ON THE CHARACTERS CREATED BY MICHAEL McDOWELL AND LARRY WILSON
Come in, if you dare.
Can the living and the dead coexist?
That’s what we’re going to find out.
My name is Lydia Deetz and welcome…
to Ghost Mansion.
Today we are joined in the attic by Emmett and…
Jodie Welch of Cleghorn, Wisconsin… along with her dog, Taco.
And today they will tell us about how the house… that they dreamed of, became a Ghost Mansion.
I have been a psychic mediator for more than 15 years.
But nothing would have prepared me for… what I found at the Welch farm…
to my visit.
This is a preview.
Caution: It’s intense.
I don’t know what I’ll find behind…
from this door, but…
That doesn’t want me here.
I can feel a dark presence.




We have to go, now!
Emmett, ready to hear about your paranormal visitors?
Tell me everything.
How about you, Jodie?
I haven’t been able to sleep since we moved…
to that horrible house.
Taco is so scared, that he becomes…
from the bathroom, in his bed, nightly.
It’s a living nightmare.
Face the unknown?
Conquer his fears?
Nothing is more difficult.
But, don’t worry, I’m going to be with…
What the hell…
No!
No! No!
What’s happening?
Don’t know.
Go.
No!
No!
You’re doing great!
What happened?
Do you need a break?
Yeah.




Let’s take a break.
Lydia Deetz, ladies and gentlemen!
Bravo!
I need five minutes, make it happen.
Okay, everyone. Let’s have lunch!
I told him to wear contact lenses, but no.
Don Mago Famoso didn’t pay attention to me.
You can stop now, Nadia!
I’m having a shitty day.
What happened there?
Are you OK?
Yes I’m fine.
Recording two shows is a lot.
It kills me to see you like this.
Because when you feel like this, I feel…
what you feel and in a strange way.
When something hurts
you, It hurts me, I don’t know.
Sorry.
I didn’t mean to make you feel that way.
Alright.
That just shows how connected we are.
Like we have the same stupid little heart.
No.
You don’t need these.




I only have one job, and it is seeing that…
don’t stifle your talents, at the bottom of…
a bottle of pills, Lydia.
Please, It’s just to get through the day.
Okay, but this is the last time I take you out…
pills from the trash, do you understand?
Or the toilet or the sink.
Okay, you can handle this, okay?
Yeah.
Is it mine?
Who is texting me?
Your stupid stepmother. She has diarrhea from the messages.
IT’S ABOUT YOUR FATHER! SEE YOU IN THE GALLERY!
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? DOES THAT FOOL HAVE YOUR PHONE?
I have to go.
Lydia.
We have one segment left to finish!
Tell us about your inspiration for the human canvas.
I am my own canvas.
I am my art.
As we know, art imitates life.
It feeds me.
And he wasn’t getting enough food, that’s all…
as a sculptor.
So I decided to broaden my tastes, and it turned out that…




I am an insatiable artist.
Delia.
Where were you?
I think I already cried all the water…
of my body.
What happened to dad?
I’m devastated, friend!
He is the Picasso of graffiti artists.
He imitated the walls of the Paris metro.
But he throws a little tantrum, because I had…
have to cancel the performance.
And what happened?
That?
Your father left me.
Did he divorce you?
What a horrible thought!
No, he’s dead.
That?
Daddy passed away.
As?
He was coming back from his observation expedition…
of birds, in the Funafuti atoll.
When his plane went down in the south…
of the Pacific.
That?
Did his plane crash?
That was his worst nightmare.
In fact, He survived the accident.
Did he drown?
Narrowly.
But not completely, no.
According to the survivors, Daddy grabbed a wing.
Here!
Come!
I was doing nothing here!
I was doing nothing here!
So how did he die?
A shark came out of the water and ate him!
Just like that!
I spoke with him on Saturday.
He was very happy.
He thanked me for the binoculars.
He said he observed the mating of the Ustuamoto sandpiper.
Yeah, He traveled to the other side of the world…
Let’s see how the birds do it on the beach.
And that killed him!
We have to tell Astrid.
Must?
She is already a very morbid little thing.
Yes, I can contact her…




We barely talk to each other.
Charles would die again, upon hearing that…
I canceled my exhibition!
Good night and see you never!
What did she say?
He disturbed Me! It’s a scandal!
You have no idea how much precious time I wasted.
But what!
Did you see that?
Good morning, sir.
Where am I?
Down the hallway, second door on the right.
Take a number.
Someone will help you.
Eventually.
Damn foreigners!
No!

WAKE UP, WE ARE FRY JOIN THE CLIMATE CREW
SUPPOSED MOM CALLING…
When they already have three children and two divorces,
Let’s see who is the one who laughs.
Perfect.
Stop bothering me.




It’s already decided, we’re taking Charles to Winter River.
But I have never organized a funeral.
I have never organized anything, without Charles…
at my side, admiring me.
Delighted.
I’m Astrid, please don’t leave your message.
She doesn’t want to answer me.
Maybe I should tell Astrid…
about Charles?
It may be easier for a male archetype…
not feminine.
There are no more men left in this family.
I’m not offended, Delia.
In short, I will be part of the family.
What’s more, I can be the perfect person…
to tell him, after I myself suffered the loss of my grandfather.
Yeah? When?
40 years ago, but for my inner child…
It was like yesterday.
I’m going to tell Astrid, Okay?
Wait for me downstairs for a few minutes.
Enough, I’ll take care of this.
Astrid!
Astrid!
Astrid!
Stop torturing your mother!
It usually amuses me when you do it, and it’s…
fair, because of the way she…
She treated me at your age.
But, not today.
Your mommy was left without her daddy.
You lost your grandfather.
And I lost my horny male.
Charles!
Charles!
Oh Charles!
I can’t believe grandpa died.
He was the only semi-normal person in this family.
We’re going to be in Winter River for a few weeks.
What about a few weeks?
Wasn’t it just for the funeral?
You have to get everything out of the house.
Grandpa loved that place.
Yeah, and that is why we are going to honor him…
with a funeral collective.
Funeral collective?
I envision a semi-multimedia visual manifesto of our loss.
What does loss look like?
Are they just tears?
A tombstone?
Dried gladiola? No!
We have to release the art of mourning!
Yes, that sounds very dramatic.
I can’t go.
Next week, I represent the school…
at the environmental conference.
We will demand action against climate change.
I already spoke with the Director and she authorized it for me.
Even she thought it was a good idea.
Of course, when you donate an entire Arts Center…
the Director immediately becomes your little puppet.
Well, you can reject your inheritance, when you live on…
your salary for hugging trees.
That? No!
No!
Hey, people already know that Lydia Deetz is my mom.
Could you stop behaving…
Like a freak, for a second?
Comes back!
So that?
People already know that you prefer to spend more time with…
the ghosts, than with your own daughter.
Jesus, Bob.
Can’t you see that I’m focused?
Look, Bob, long distance relationships…
They can be difficult.
Especially if one is dead and the other…
He’s been ignoring you for 30 years.
But Lydia and I have a strong…
psychic connection.
I need to get those people out of my house!
Please wait, Call Center from Beyond!
Please wait!
What is the price of premium bioexorcism?
But I’ll tell you something…
She definitely saw me last time.
Give me my money back!
I felt ticklish!
I’m going to put her call through.
I just died!
And she has already remarried.
Sell ​​him the Honeymoon package, I kill the new husband
and possess the ex-wife, so that she can do dishonorable things.
And then I post the photos.
Can you pay in months or…
Help me. These people don’t…
They need me upstairs.
Bob, hold down the fort.
It didn’t work.
Give me my money back.
Where am I?
Take a number and sit down.
I’m more of a dog person.
You! Office 515!
Now!
Come on!
Walk!
Be careful with the suit!
No non-Detective!
Another protester!
There is a 10-09…
Wolf Jackson!
Anticrime Force!
From Beyond.
Let’s see if I guess.
Actor.
Not just any actor.
I did everything.
Six films and a remake.
I became Frank Hardboiler.
Doing my stunts was non-negotiable.
And do you know why?
Authenticity.
Correct.
A Narcotics Captain doesn’t knock on a
door and wait for a drug addict to come to…
knock it down and neither can I.
You have to keep it real.
Sounds like you came out a little too real there, don’t you, buddy?
I didn’t know it was a real grenade.
Your name was mentioned in this case…
that I investigate.
Do you recognize this kitten?
Well, I never met her in my life.
Or in the next one.
BETELGEUSE IS MINE!
Any idea why my suspect she wrote…
your name, with that fool’s drool?
I don’t know, Wolf.
She may be a super fan.
Guys like us bring the girls crazy.
I put together all the parts of her body.
My intuition says she’s out for revenge.
And you seem to be number one in hers…
murder list
Well, she won’t be the first woman he wants…
kill me
And it is not easy to murder a deceased person.
She can.
She is a soul sucker.
Yeah. You have no idea.
I recommend you be discreet.
If you put your hands on it, You will be a deceased dead.
And she can’t come back from that, Mr. Juice.
Understood.

I just can’t believe I won’t see again…
to Charles again.
Take comfort in knowing that he is in a place…
far better.
The angels guide him towards the eternal
light and his soul will fly like the birds that…
He adored him so much and he will tour the Elysian Fields, until…
the glory that awaits us.
That?
Since dad’s, He wasn’t going to a funeral.
Death is hard.
Yes, sometimes I think life is worse.
I know.
Hey, if you want to talk to the therapist…
again…
There you go again.
You always run away from any conversation about dad.
Astrid…
I loved your father, but our relationship…
It was over long before the accident.
I still don’t understand why you don’t see him.
Why not?
That’s what I would like to know.
But this ability didn’t exactly come…
with instructions.
It all started when I was your age.
How ironic, right?
You watch any ghost for your shitty
TV show, but the only ghost I
actually care about, you can’t watch at all.
It’s closed!
Sorry for the inconvenience.
My name is Charles Deetz.
I feel like I lost my mind.
Where am I?
Stupid newbies.
Wait!
Waiting room!
Alright.
Incredible!
Who is there?
My ex-wife is back.
I know what you’re thinking.
When was Beetlejuice chained?
What kind of woman could keep him satisfied?
Well…
I’ll tell them!
In a forgotten time, surrounded by death and
plague, the tentacles of our love were spread.
I was a humble grave robber,
trading in abandoned corpses.
My heart had long ago withered into the abyss.
But fate, like a ghost, cast its long
shadow, on a cold, starless night.
Her name was Delores.
From the moment I looked into his cursed eyes, I was spellbound.
It was a traditional ceremony.
We drank each other’s blood…
we ripped the heads off a couple of chickens…
and we sacrificed a goat.
Our wedding night…
It was a symphony of carnal pleasures.
A macabre opera of lust…
and unbridled desire.
But my new wife harbored a sinister secret…
She was the leader of a…
deadly sect that sucked souls.
Like a spider approaching its
prey, it was ready to attack.
His quest for immortality required two things…
My life… And my soul!
POISON Hey, I
have strange tastes too.
But even I have limits… so…
We separate.
And now she’s back.
And she is furious.
There must be a lot of noise there, right?
And here too.
Listen, if you need to process any of…
your emotions, I am here for you.
Emotions already processed. Thank you.
I saw how you looked at your grandfather’s grave.
He must have been a great guy.
Death is, like…
It’s tragic, isn’t it?
And, if you want to cry, or rant against the…
feelings that you have stored there, I want you to know…
that I can be…
a very cool father to you.
I’m fine.
Well, these moments can strangely unite…
a family
I walk here, I wrote a poem to…
your grandfather
Oh really?
And what does he say?
It’s, it’s, it’s…
Start…
I mean, it talks about pain,
obviously, and acceptance.
It’s long, I didn’t learn it, or anything,
but, it turned out very nice to me.
Rory, cut the fuck off.
I don’t buy your New Age stories, super
sentimental, about sharing your traumas in…
yoga retreats.
I see you as you are.
Just like you, my mom is a person…
very defective, who hallucinates and fantasizes.
And you exploit her, and if she allows you, it’s up to her.
I’m sorry.
I know, thank you.
But if she is the little one Jane Butterfield.
And little Jane?
I’m Jane Butterfield-Lee now.
I carry it with a script.
Is it Maxi Dean?
No.
No, no one has arrived.
Samples, from my husband’s microbrewery.
Micro, would they be for people who have micro mouths?
Why is your house covered in black cloth?
It is a death veil.
With the death of Charles, also dies…
this house, and I am protecting it in the transition from it.
To a new life, with a new family.
I’m dying to show it.
There is already a line of buyers, Thanks to you, Lydia.
Everyone wants to buy the Original Ghost Mansion.
Ghosts are not real.
Only naive people believe that kind of shit.
At least it pays the bills, right, mom?
Okay, honey, let’s go.
May I have your attention, please?
That?
We are gathered to celebrate life…
of an extraordinary man.
And I only had the pleasure of being with Charles a few times.
And I can tell you that he wouldn’t want speeches.
Charles hated public displays of affection.
Yes, but he also…
he chose to live his life fully.
And I’m going to follow Charles Deetz and his great example.
Lydia, I know the intention was to go slowly…
in this relationship, but I can’t wait anymore.
Let’s get married at your favorite party.
Do you want to marry me on Halloween?
That, that would be in two days!
Yes, I know.
I already spoke with Father Damon and…
the Church will be available.
The sanctuary of the Lord welcomes those who…
They seek salvation and eternal glory.
Only not before twelve, nor from three to four.
Did you seriously think of doing this today at Charles’s funeral?
Yes, yes.
Yes, why…
Because being here, surrounded by death, we have to…
commit ourselves to choosing life.
Because I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Lydia.
And with you, Delia.
And with you, too.
And with you, again.
What do you say to me?
Rory, I can’t commit to this now.
Alright.
It’s just that I’ve already lost so much.
What are you taking about?
Well, first the death of Charles, then the…
death of my grandfather, you know it.
And now he dies…
ours.
No no, but it wasn’t my intention.
I thought you wanted to bungee jump…
life, with me, without networks, or anything, right?
But I think the only thing that jumped…
in bungee today, it’s love.
And the rope broke.
Come on, Rory, I love you.
And I love you.
What are we waiting for?
Okay, I think…
My God…
He said “yes”!
She said yes.
Astrid!
♪ I don’t like it at all

Sorry, I’m not going to tell him!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Careful!
Are you OK?
Are you OK? What happened?
Yeah.
I will live.
And what do you read?
It’s “Crime and Punishment.”
You are one of those.
I’m one of those.
And what does that mean?
Nothing.
I’ve already read it three times.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Grief and suffering are inevitable.
Yeah.
But…
It’s incredible that you quote Dostoevsky.
Where have you been all my life?
How long have you lived in Winter River?
Of all my life.
I’ve never seen you around here.
Yes. It was a temporary stopover for the funeral of…
my grandfather
Until my mom’s asshole boyfriend…
he turned it at an engagement party, all of a sudden.
He even announced the wedding date.
That is…
different.
Yes. If you knew my mom, It’s typical of her.
And your father is not listed or…
No.
He was a free spirit.
He defended lost causes.
They separated and he went to Brazil.
To try to save the jungle.
But mom grew up here, in the old house on the hill.
In the Ghost Mansion?
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?
Unfortunately.
She is a legend!
Well yes, for those who believe in supernatural shit.
You don’t believe?
No.
In what I see, It’s what I believe in.
Like science. Facts.
Yes, and it will continue like this.
Back to the madness.
By the way, sorry about your fence.
Tell your parents that my mom is going to pay them.
It doesn’t matter.
Surely they won’t even notice.
Hey, I’ll be here…
tomorrow.
If you want a…
rest from madness.
Witnesses described her as the soulsucker of Lost and Found.
Shall I tell you the weird part, Boss?
Tell me.
After leaving the owner like a human hotcake,
stole a wedding dress.
Clear.
The stapled crazy woman is excited about a meeting…
romantic, with Mr. Juice.
She won’t stop killing, until she returns it…
to take to the altar.
Cases like this make me question why…
I became a police officer.
You are not a police officer. You are an actor.
Thanks, Janet.
You keep me real.
Should we put that Beetlejuice in police protection?
If you find it.
He must be hidden.
Crazy panicked.
Louder, guys.
Don’t let Delores go through that door.
Bob.
Almost like looking in a mirror.
You see, Bob… You will be my decoy.
You will go in front of me, at all times.
So she will suck your soul, while I run away.
Do you understand?
OBITUARY
CHARLES DEETZ
ARTIST WIFE SURVIVES HIM AND DAUGHTER DRIVER
Now is my chance.
No.
That?!
Because?
No, no, no…
Delia, what’s wrong?
I try to capture the perfect primal scream.
I’m going to print it, I will put it on
the wall and I want you to do it too.
So that?
For the collective.
It is not sincere to celebrate only the good of…
our deceased, without first letting go of the horror…
that provoked us.
And what horrible thing did grandpa do to you?
He bought this house without telling me.
My God!
He came from buying boxes in town and…
I heard you scream, are you okay?
It was Delia.
Oh, Delia.
I’m fine!
Ignore her.
You are very considerate.
Astrid, can you help him with the boxes?
I told the movers to come in…
a week, okay?
I think that will give us time to get over…
grief and trauma.
And then after the wedding, I think we
should go back and finish the programs.
Maybe mom will tell the ghosts in the attic to help us.
Adam and Barbara Maitland. They no longer live here.
Did they go to own another house?
No, we saw a legal loophole and they were able to move forward.
How convenient.
CALL NOW! WE ARE #1
BIOEXORCIST
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A LOVE CONNECTION?
I thought she had lost them.
That was taken in a Mario Bava Horror Festival.
I was nine months pregnant with you.
My water broke during “Kill Baby Kill.
” Dad’s favorite movie.
Yeah.
Can I keep them?
Yeah.
And I like the model of Winter River.
Did grandpa make it?
No, that was the Maitlands.
You already know.
The non-existent ghost couple.
That was on the floor.
Who is Beetlejuice?
Never say that name. Never, ever.
-Beetlejuice.
No, Astrid!
I’m serious.
If you repeat that name three times, things will happen…
very bad.
That?
What’s more, You are prohibited from going up to the attic.
Do you understand me?
Yes, I understand that you are crazy.
My God, it’s you.
I thought a moose was coming to attack me.
They are breathing exercises.
Try to see ghosts every day.
Astrid!
Leave her.
She hates me.
She still thinks that Richard’s death was…
my fault
You blame me for your mother’s.
She’s not dead.
And, I never blamed you.
She resented you. It’s different.
You weren’t very nice.
No, you barely noticed it existed.
But it turned out well in the end, right?
Yeah.
Since what I do made me famous…
We got very close.
No, I liked you a little before that.
The terrifying breathing again!
Works!
I learned it at the survivors’ retreat, that’s where…
I met Rory.
Of course.
And he was shocked by Richard’s death.
And I worked on my unresolved feelings.
And Rory had just lost his fiancee…
in a ski accident.
We were in the same circle of pain.
And we connect…
Yeah.
He liked you a lot, at the worst moment of your life.
I don’t breathe like that for him.
Astrid found this in the attic.
AND?
AND?
From time to time I can feel it present.
Like it was lurking around me.
In the distance.
But lately I’ve seen it again.
And I hoped he was in my head.
But now this appears.
Lydia, you have to get your life back.
Of your flatterers.
Of this thing.
Where is the annoying little goth girl, who…
tormented so many years ago?
It’s time to find her.
Hello.
Hello.
Jeremy, is that you?
Yeah.
Mom, I’m going to be upstairs with a friend.
Okay, have fun.
Hello, dad.
Son.
He lives it up in that room.
Lots of vinyl from the nineties.
Did you buy them on eBay?
No, in record stores.
I don’t trust what I can’t touch.
Manual of the Recent Deceased.
I found it at a garage sale.
In the town.
The illustrations are very crazy.
Yeah, it’s the kind of book shit, that my mother would endorse.
What’s going on with your parents?
Well, my mom spends all her time in the kitchen.
Baking from stress.
And my dad worked in the paper
factory, but he had an accident.
And now he spends his time glued to the couch.
I can’t wait to get out of this shitty town.
You must have traveled to many places…
with your famous mom?
Almost not.
Dad was more the traveler, anyway.
We had plans to visit the top ten places…
terrifying of the Earth.
That is, the Tower of London, Dracula’s Castle and…
Yes, but we never had the chance to do it.
What happened to him?
Boat accident.
They tried to find him in the Amazon
for weeks and his body did not appear.
Do you really miss him?
Yeah.
Yes, even if it was I would have wanted to say goodbye.
What, your mom can’t contact him?
She says she can’t see him.
Why not?
Because she is a fraud.
Well, that sounds strong.
Well, tomorrow is Halloween.
I know.
It was my favorite party.
Because my dad got excited making the costumes…
less appropriate.
Yeah, I think when I was in Second Grade,
I wore a costume from Munch’s “The Scream.”
Yes, it was by choice.
Yeah.
But my mom is getting married that day and, I don’t
know, it’s probably not going to be my favorite party anymore.
What time is the wedding?
At midnight.
The witching hour.
My future stepfather’s stupid idea.
Well, why don’t you come with me?
Before.
We can, I don’t know, order pizza, hand out sweets
Only if you want.
But there is no, there is no, there is no pressure.
And these sinister birds?
Watching birds was my father’s passion.
I contacted the vintage store in Soho.
They sent several possible wedding dresses.
They are supposed to arrive shortly.
Brilliant! Thank you.
And a little bird perhaps spoke of…
wedding with several newsreels.
You have to sell the photos exclusively.
It will be good publicity for the program.
Hey, the wedding really makes me happy, but…
Could it be something smaller and more private?
Yes of course.
It’s your big day.
Night or whatever.
Hello, I have a fever all over my body.
Throughout the body.
SENSUAL MAN LOOK FOR BURNING LADY
Lydia?
I want you out of my life!
Did you hear me?
Lydia?
Who are you yelling at?
Remember the couples therapist we saw?
Dr. Clickman said something was holding me back
and until I faced it, you and I…
we would not evolve.
Well he was right.
And, now I’m going to tell you.
But I’m warning you, it’s going to sound very crazy.
Is that okay with you?
Well of course, I would love to.
Let’s break down that barrier together.
Okay, just give me a second.
When I was a teenager, a deceitful demon terrified…
my whole family and he wanted to force me to get married…
with him, so that he could return to the real world.
Eternally.
I thought he would be gone forever.
And lately I’ve seen it again.
And now, I’m actually back.
And I don’t know why or how, nor what to do.
Okay, so you say someone named Beetlejuice…
No… say his name!
If you say his name three times, he’s going to show up.
Okay.
And this demon is clearly a construct of…
your repressed traumas.
Traumas that you have to face or…
Otherwise, they will get worse.
He is not a construct.
He is literally a demon.
I know this is an important step for you.
But in the words of Dr. Clickman, I’ll…
to give the push you need.
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS? ME TOO!
COUPLE THERAPISTWhat just happened?
We are in the model.
That’s not possible.
What the hell?
I told you not to say his name!
Beetlejuice!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Never say that name!
Never, ever!
You have to get out of here, now!
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!
Is that… -Beetlejuice.
First, I want to tell you kids,
this is a safe space, Okay?
Express yourself freely, don’t be afraid.
I feel like there’s a drainer, But I’ll get to that.
Look, think about it and get it all out, okay?
Who wants to be the first?
Okay, I’ll go.
Ready. This is how I commit to work.
They have to be in touch with their inner child.
Mine will come in a little while.
Everyone tells me that he has my eyes.
Personally, I don’t see it.
Let’s fly, kid!
They are my repressed traumas, They are my repressed traumas.
You are a figment of my imagination!
Really?
Is this a figment of your imagination?
Just like his father. He loves legs.
It was you who was stalking me!
Hey, if stalking means…
Remarrying the love of my life…
Well, I’m guilty as charged, come here.
Home, home, home!
♪ Wherever you go Whatever you do
♪ I will be here waiting for you
What happened?
I dreamed something crazy.
Yes, I think we should stop taking the pills.
LIVING CARGO HANDLE WITH CARE LIVE REPTILES
Vipers.
In fact, asps.
They are not beautiful.
A wedding gift for Rory?
Very late. They don’t have fangs.
They are already harmless.
And, they are for me.
In Ancient Egypt, The Queen wore…
perform a ritual, in Pharaoh’s tomb of her,
using snakes, as a symbol of her eternal love.
Are you sure about that?
I read that for Ra, They were a constant siege…
in the Underworld and represented total chaos.
That’s why schools need more art and less reading.
Your wish came true.
We’re leaving.
Pack your things, I’m going to take you back to school.
Wait. What happened?
You won’t believe me, yes I tell you.
I’ll pay a whole fleet of movers…
Let them take everything back to Manhattan.
Except for the model.
You have to break it into a thousand pieces and burn it.
And are you going to cancel the wedding?
What did that brainless guy do to you?
It wasn’t Rory.
He is here, in the model.
I saw it.
Rory too, but he believed that he was dreaming.
Wait. We can’t leave yet.
I have plans.
Tomorrow with a new friend.
When did you have time to meet a boy?
While you were planning to get married.
It’s not to hurt you, It’s just karma.
I was on the bike and then I crashed…
against his fence and we started talking.
He invited me to his house to spend Halloween.
Can I go, mom?
Please?
I will not allow that threat…
to humanity, bother our family again.
No one will go in there and no one will say his name.
We’ll be fine, right?
Mom, come on, I’m late!
Trick or Treat!
Guys, not that house.
Are you sure this is the correct address?
Yes, 125 Jefferson Street.
Don’t judge.
Her father had an accident at work
and they are not having a good time.
It’s cute!
What are you doing?
I want to say hello to your parents.
Oh really?
This is not a play date.
I’m not six years old, nothing will happen to me.
Very good, okay?
It’s true.
Have fun and I’ll come get you at 10 o’clock.
And not a second later.
Trick or Treat!
I went down to look in the basement.
I forgot we had all this.
Yes, you really shined.
Yeah.
I like your costume James Dean, by the way.
Thank you.
Yes, my parents say I look like Richie from Happy Days.
Your costume looks great.
Who are you supposed to be?
Marie Curie.
French physicist, winner of two Nobel Prizes and feminist icon.
She was the one who discovered radiation, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, she had no idea that would kill her.
Yes, well, for someone dying of poisoning…
by radiation, you are…
beautiful.
I went to buy sweets.
Lots of sweets.
Maybe there are too many.
We can, I don’t know, eat the leftovers, if you want.
Or we can distribute them now, if that’s what you want to do.
Yes, I have a confession, in fact.
I’d rather stay up here, with you.
Okay.
Yes, that works too.
Please don’t be scared.
What are you?
Don’t you know?
Astrid, seriously, you don’t have to be scared.
You are a ghost.
My mom told the truth. Shit!
When my parents fought, I stole from them…
a six pack of beers to my dad and I hid…
in the tree house.
And one day, I slipped and fell.
And how long ago did that happen?
Twenty three years, five months and fourteen days.
But who’s counting?
I’ve been trapped in this house for twenty-three years.
I can’t get past that tree and…
I spend my time looking at the world outside.
But you appeared and you can see me.
I’ve been alone for so long, It was like a…
grenade will explode in my head.
It was incredible.
You are amazing.
I have to go.
Astrid, I know, I know, It’s weird, but I
really like you and I want us to be together.
As?
You are dead, I am alive, it doesn’t make sense.
Well, And if I told you that I found the…
way to become human again.
It’s all in this book.
When you die, They all give us one of these.
It’s something complicated, but I can only do it…
with the help of a living person.
And seriously, you could give me my life back?
I don’t know, We could ask my mom, she’s
supposed to be the expert on the dead, right?
Yeah, well, she sure will give you…
a million reasons just for you to walk away, but…
I will give you a reason to help me.
You could see your dad again.
The official open house is next Sunday
and then we’ll let the bidding war begin.
And Rory?
He went to the supermarket, to change the sweets…
that I bought, for carrots, because Rory loves to fuck…
fun, even at Halloween.
I’m in a hurry, I’ll see you at Church.
If you don’t cancel the wedding before.
No, Delia.
Where are you going?
To the cemetery, to live with the spirit of…
my beloved husband.
And I have to run away, I’m a chaperone…
from little Jane’s Scout troop.
We spent weeks deciding on everyone’s
costumes and it was agreed that nothing from Disney.
The only thing closest I’ve seen to Disney…
It was when Astrid dressed up as Cinderella’s dead mother.
You won’t guess what the girls
decided to be, fruits and salads.
Doesn’t it seem clever to you, It is healthy and not scary.
I’m going to go…
Reverse mortgage, which is a mortgage but in reverse.
Where is Astrid?
On a date, her first.
I think I’m more nervous than her.
The boy lives in Jefferson.
Don’t mention that street.
I have a house there that prevents me from achieving…
the sales record.
But it’s my fault, The property has been around for years…
on sale.
I thought that if I sold the murder house…
It would look good on my record.
Homicide house?
What house?
The one at 125.
It’s the number where I left Astrid, there…
I would see a boy named Jeremy.
Jeremy Fraser.
No, I don’t know his last name.
No, it can’t be him.
But Jeremy Fraser was a bad boy.
23 years ago, He killed his parents.
The Police found him hiding in his tree house.
When they wanted to take him down he fell, he broke…
the neck and suffered instant death.
Does that only have to be done to go to the Beyond?
Draw a door with chalk?
And knock three times.
I just do what it says there.
How simple.
Maybe it’s not that simple.
And what do we do? Enter and that’s it?
I can, but since you’re still alive, you have to…
read that incantation first.
Demundo vivorum adeo intertum.
FOR SALE
Astrid!
Jeremy? It’s you?
Okay. I think it worked.
Astrid!
Let’s go see your dad.
Astrid! No!
Okay, very good.
Alright.
Okay, you just wait here.
I’m going to ask where I’m supposed to go.
And ask where my dad is.
Excuse me, sorry.
Sorry, I’m going to…
Merry christmas!
Merry christmas!
INFORMATION
Thank you.
Okay, you have to go to Immigration.
NO EXIT
Excuse me, Can I speak to your manager?
My wife is going to kill me, If I don’t come home soon.
How cute. Take a number and sit down.
Friend!
Powers of eternal life!
R.I.P. CHARLES DEETZ FATHER, HUSBAND, BIRD WATCHER.
Accept my Charles, how I have accepted his death!
No, I didn’t accept it.
I won’t even accept it.
Sadness never expires.
That sounded good.
Although sadness never expires!
Kings of commerce!
Gentlemen of Nasdaq!
Understand that he is worthy of walking through the door…
of the Kingdom of him.
You will not be my King again, but with…
the blessing of the angels of eternal love…
I, your Queen who survives you, I will gladly accept the throne of your…
Okay, here. Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you okay, honey?
You look a little upset.
It’s pre-wedding nerves…
I’ll just go upstairs and try on the dress.
But don’t go up, because it’s bad luck…
See me before the ceremony.
Clear.
Look! Hello!
Who is clowning?
Trick or Treat! Trick or Treat!
Here you go!
Apples, carrots and some raisins, because no one…
He likes fat clowns.
I can’t believe I’m going to do this.
Beetlejuice!
Beetlejuice!
Beetlejuice!
The Juice is loose.
I need you to tell me what this means.
Let’s see, let’s take a look.
Not to make a long story short, Your daughter is screwed.
She decided to exchange lives with that boy.
He comes back and she stays on the other side, permanently.
It’s a one-way ticket on the Soul Train.
The Soul Train?
That’s how it is. Last stop… The beyond.
No, we shouldn’t let her get on that train.
You have to put me in there, so I can get it out of her.
Well, I can take you, but it’s a give and give.
Of course yes. What do you want?
Well, I have an ex-wife, okay?
First of all, she is a big crazy woman.
I left her, but she doesn’t give up.
If I could stay away from her forever, it would be…
Do you want me to marry you?
I thought you wouldn’t ask me.
How do I know that you will keep your word?
For the soul of my mother, I swear.
Alright. Perfect!
I marry you, yes you help me save my daughter.
I’ll need it in writing.
The little hand? And that’s it!
I’m going to make you so happy!
Jesus! What is the plan to enter?
Yeah…
Yeah, you can’t exactly get through the front door.
I need demonic possession.
He is a boy and…
The worker is on strike and the waiting room is full.
Tell Beetlejuice those people are still at my house.
Hello? Hello?
They never saw us!
Do you understand?
Bob!
You and the boys stand guard.
Let no one pass.
Come on, honey.
Okay, everyone! Get back to work!
Trick or Treat!
Trick or treat!
Wait.
One each. Don’t cheat.
Yes of course.
Asshole.
Okay, everyone. Strawberries pick first this time.
Don’t push each other.
Hands up, stupid!
Or I’m going to paint the wall with your little brain!
1031.
Not like that!
Your turn.
It sounds very forced.
Remember, say it casual, spontaneous.
You have to keep it real!
Alert!
Olga!
What the hell is happening?
We have a code 699 violation.
Are you going to tell me that a living person entered illegally…
to the Beyond?
699.
Let the Gul Squad come!
Violation 699.
I need a thorough search for two suspects.
A scumbag who goes by the name of Beetlejuice.
And a flesh and blood female.
A certain Lydia Deetz.
Break down all the doors.
Do not leave any tombstone unturned.
Yes, strain to the sands of time…
if necessary.
Men.
For this they have been training all their deaths.
And remember…
You have to keep it real!
Yeah!
What the hell!
Where am I…
No! No…
No!
No!
No…
Excuse me.
What if it was a mistake?
Because I shouldn’t be here.
Are you serious?
No!
I have global entry.
There won’t be a special line?
The 8:35 train to the Beyond…
comes on time.
Following.
Stand on the marks and look directly at…
the camera.
The 8 o’clock train…
Say whiskey!
He will leave for the…
Are you OK?
No.
I feel strange.
I feel great.
Who would have thought?
And what just happened?
Well, it’s easy.
Do you remember the incantation I told you to recite?
You agreed to exchange your life for mine.
That?
I needed your life so I could walk free.
She has a seat on the Soul Train.
Going to the Beyond.
If you hurry, she can take the 8:35 one.
Thank you so much.
No, wait.
I never accepted this!
How do I come back to life?
They should seal this for you. Window eleven.
The transfer will not be permanent until then.
Dad?
Astrid?
Dad!
Dad!
Help me!
Dad!
Astrid.
Soon, my beloved. Soon.
Alert. Violation of code 699.
All clear. Come on.
We’re like Bonnie and Clyde, but without bullet holes.
Are you sure you know where you’re going?
You go straight down the hallway.
Three rights to gate nine and straight…
to Soul Train.
And where are you going?
I have to go to the bathroom first.
OUTPUTS
Let’s go! Yeah!
ETERNAL GLORY IN TIME DELAYED HEAVENLY DOOR
This is the 8:35 train to the Beyond.
All aboard.
To Soul Train.
No!
No!
No!
Astrid! Astrid!
No no…
Please!
Move!
Move that hip, mom!
Astrid.
High!
There!
By the way, I saw dad.
Where are we?
Don’t know!
That’s Saturn!
This must be one of his Moons!
The Beyond is super random!
Sandworm!
Runs!
Give me your hand!
Here! Come on!
Shut up!
Marie Curie, already poisoned by radiation, right?
I learned from the best.
We made a great girl.
Yes, we did it.
Come!
I know they don’t see me, but I’m taking care of them all the time.
And I don’t want to be the reason they break up.
They are needed.
The two complement each other.
Since always.
Alert, we have a violation.
We have to go back to Winter River.
They won’t be able to leave, until Astrid get her life back.
Come on, let’s go.
The Gul Squad already found the opening and sealed it.
Any trace of Mr. Beetlejuice or the flesh and blood?
They keep searching, but we found something that may be useful.
Bob?
Let me tell you how this will go.
Either you move those wrinkled lips, or I will thunder…
your horrible little head, like a pistachio.
Where is Beetlejuice?!
Rowdy?
Father, I see people with their heads shrunken, everywhere.
“But do not fear, for your eyes will see strange things.
” Do you feel fear and tremble?
Yes, I’m shitting my pants.
And what are you doing here?
I look for lost sheep, to bring them back to the light.
Why don’t I take you to church?
Trick or Treat!
Sorry, sorry.
Now I’m back in line.
Just, excuse me, just…
Sorry, I just… I’m late for a wedding.
Yes, a question.
How do I get out of here?
Because someone made a serious mistake.
It’s my rest.
Take a number and sit down.
No, the asps left their fangs.
I paid extra to have them removed.
Honey, you’re already dead, okay?
Now take a number and sit down.
Is there anyone who has the power to help me?
Has saying that worked for you before?
I… I’m not dead!
You know what, my husband is here.
Charles Deetz.
Yes, he can fix it.
Call him, he’ll fix it. He fixes everything.
He can’t fix anything anymore.
No, wait, wait. I have influences.
I have influences. I am influential!
No.
Beetlejuice.
No.
Beetlejuice.
Bee…
Here I am.
I understand now.
Since you are dead, Do you want to join me?
Would you help me find Charles, please?
And then the VIP room?
Clear!
Okay.
After you help me find…
to my runaway girlfriend.
Where is he?
Tell me.
Don’t cross the line, until they call him.
Don’t stamp that passport!
They were late, man.
Wasn’t it Dostoevsky who said…
SHIT LUCK!
Goodbye, asshole.
This way, follow me.
Following.
Alert. Intruders detected.
Here.
This is code 699.
We have intruders…
Okay, that’s as far as I’m going.
Alright. I love you.
I love you too, darling.
Have an amazing life.
And take care of yourselves.
Yeah.
Very good.
I’ll see them.
Okay.
Thank you for saving my life.
Sorry I never thought you saw ghosts and…
I don’t know, sorry for everything.
Astrid, no…
Lydia, quick! It’s too late!
My God! My wedding!
Let’s get started!
That? Mom, with everything that happened, you know that…
You don’t have to do this, right?
No! But if I don’t do it today, I’m never going to do it.
But are you sure about this?
Rory loves me and that should be enough.
Quick, dear!
Come on, come on!
She welcomes the lost sheep with open arms.
Oh my God!
I thought you regretted it.
No, believe me.
He just came to save me from a hellish day.
Who are all these people?
Just a couple of influencers.
No one with less than 5 million followers.
And I think there is a streaming executive.
Will we do this?
Yeah.
And your dress?
It only matters that I came, so let’s go straight…
to the votes.
Where is Delia?
Right here.
She helped me calm down before the wedding.
They gave me tickles.
Alright, get lost.
You! Are you that thing from my dream?
Well, I’m more the stuff of nightmares, but thanks.
Are you Beetle…
Part of the agreement is that they will never say my name again.
Never!
What agreement?
The one she signed to save you.
By the way, you can tell me, pa’.
Lydia?
Did you agree to be his wife?
She was desperate and she was my only option.
Lydia, what’s going on here?
Uncomfortable!
I haven’t seen any progress since our last session.
So I’m going to suggest drug therapy.
Don’t be afraid to share, when you’re ready.
I always thought your whole act was a lie.
I never believed in ghosts, spirits, or anything like that.
That? After all this time?
And why did you want to marry me?
For money!
I knew I would earn more like your husband, than as your manager.
And I never had a dead fiancée.
I only went to the survivors’ retreat,
to meet weak women to exploit them.
In you I found the mine of codependency.
Would physical therapy be okay for you?
We want to thank you for coming to this…
special occasion, but right now we would like a little privacy.
Where are you going, Father?
Honey, I have one more surprise, and this is from my heart.

Mr. Juice, she has violated code 69…
Stay still!
Sign it up, Sergeant.
Beetlejuice!
But what the hell?
I’m back.
Dear.
You look fantastic, so…
recomposed.
He is mine!
It’s me, it’s not you.
You know, honey?
I’ve changed a lot lately.
Sort of a mid-life crisis after death, I guess.
Your soul belongs to me, my love.
For all eternity.
You don’t want to spend eternity with me.
I’m a lone wolf you need a soul mate.
Someone who really sees you, for example this guy.
I LOVE DELORES
I need something to draw.
Fast.
Sandworms!
Worst wedding ever, huh?
Come on, little hat!
Come on, this way! Well, well, well!
Olé, monster!
Let’s go.
Hey, we had a deal.
She won’t have to marry you.
MARRIAGE AGREEMENT
You violated code 699.
Yes, you illegally took my mother to the Afterlife.
According to the book, that contract will no longer have any validity.
Look, I’m sorry things didn’t work out…
between us, but 600 years apart…
old, it was too much for me.
Beetle…
Beetlejuice.
Beetlejuice.
Beetlejuice.
We should have gotten married in Las Vegas.
I think we arrived a little late, guys.
Let the area be closed.
Call the coroner and keep the damn media out of it.
Miss, it blew up Beetlejuice.
Say goodbye.
You can take a selfie if you want, but quickly.
Madam, you are coming with me.
That? Delia, what did you do?
I let myself be scammed.
And I’m counting on you to ask for a refund.
The snakes were poisonous TRUE?
Yes, and I died of shame.
Your art will go up in price.
Very well, then.
Delia, I’m going to miss you.
No you won’t, I’ll look for Charles and…
We will scare them, until they ask us to move forward.
Good job for a couple of meat and bones.
Don’t come knocking again, until your time comes.
And in the meantime, remember, You have to keep it real.
Come on, beautiful, we have an appointment with the Commissioner.
Charles!
Delia!
I can’t believe you’re here.
Oh, Charles.
I’m very happy to see you.
Charles, look what happened to me.
This is the 10:13 train to the Beyond.
All aboard the Soul Train.
I want to thank all the Fantasfans.
For your support during these years.
But, This will be my last program.
I’ve spent too many years talking
to the dead and it’s my turn to live.
I want to create memories with the people I love.
Instead of being bewitched later.
Everything’s fine.
I see the head now.
You are doing well.
My God! What’s that?
What is this?
Mommy!
I had a very strange dream."

The crow will guide you to put the wrong things right.
People once believed…
People once believed when someone dies,
a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead.
But sometimes, something so bad happens
that a terrible sadness is carried with it.
And the soul cannot rest.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
…will guide you.
And the soul cannot rest.
Shelly?
Shelly, baby.
No, no, no, no, no, no. It’s okay.
It’s okay. Don’t… Look, come down from there.
It’s okay. No, no, no, no, no!
No!
(GASPS)
(CROWS CAWING)
She’s dead, isn’t she?
We’re both dead.
I’m afraid so.
(SNIFFLES)
What are you?
Some kind of angel?
(LAUGHS)
Do I look like an angel?
ERIC: I don’t understand.
Why am I here and she isn’t?
You’re not gonna like the answer.
Just tell me.
She’s on her way down.
To a place far worse than this.
You said I could make the wrong things right.
What does that mean?
The one who killed you is not supposed to be in your world.
They made a deal with the devil
to gain eternal life
by sending the innocent to hell.
That’s not balance.
Kill them.
Kill them all.
And you get your lives back.
You’re saying I can get her back?
Yeah.
Kill the ones who killed you,
and you will get her back.
(CAWING)
When I was up there,
I got shot.
And it taught you something, didn’t it?
What I, um… I can heal?
I can’t die?
Your body? No.
Feel pain? Yes.
If your love remains pure, you cannot die.
How am I supposed to trust you?
Do you have another choice?
Are you ready?
Holy shit.
Eric, what the fuck?
Where have you been? Everyone thought you was dead.
Everyone was right.
Very funny. Just come inside.
I need your help, man.
What do you need?
I need a gun.
A gun.
Eric, what… What are you gonna do with a…
You know what, it’s not my…
You’re going to need these.

Who was after her?
Why did you come for her that day?
I saw you there with the people who killed her.
What are you talking about?
It was an overdose.
How would you know?
Because I was there.
You don’t understand who you’re dealing with.
I loved her.
I need to know who these people are
because I’m going to kill them.
Every single one of them.
And I’m gonna bring her back.
She’s not coming back.
My baby’s gone.
She’s gone.
And she’s not coming back.

I’m sorry it’s been so long.
Truly.
My condolences.
Shelly was such a special girl.
I heard you had a visitor.
(ANGRILY) What did he want?
He wants to kill you.
Oh. Anger.
First impulse. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
It’s not anger.
What is it, then?
Love.
Loved her so much.
He told me he was going to bring her back.
What was that?
He thinks if he kills you,
he’ll be able to bring her back from the dead.
(UNEASY MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, Shelly.
So many times you needed me, and I was never there.
Stop it.
She’s gone.
You traded her for a better life.
That took a lot of courage.
What you gave me was not a gift,
it was a curse.
I would rather have died.

That woman who was after her, who is she?
Who, Marion?
No. No. She’s just part of it.
She just works for him.
Who are you talking about? Who?
His name is Vincent Roeg, man.
He used to have us over to party.
I thought it was just an easy place to score.
That shit got so dark.
He made it so dark.
He’s got this voice, man.
Voice.
He… burrows inside you.
Finds the darkest parts of your soul
and gives them a voice.
And it just gets louder and louder
until you do something evil.
I still hear it.
I never would have made that fucking video
if I’d known what would have happened, man.
What video?
Where is it?
Shelly had it on her phone.
Said she had it hidden.
She didn’t want anyone to see it.
I tried to warn her, but she wouldn’t leave without you.
I knew Shelly a long time.
When I saw the way she looked at you,
something was different.
I tried to do something right, man.

I never doubted her.
Didn’t you?
You had a chance and you wasted it.
You were given the power of a god.
In the end, you were just a boy.
At least your soul can move on.
Her soul is gone forever into the darkness.
For you, eternity is easy.
You just have to breathe.
And let her go.
I can’t.

Genre: Horror, Thriller, Supernatural

Director: Gary Dauberman

Writers: Stephen King, Gary Dauberman

Stars: Lewis Pullman, Makenzie Leigh, Jordan Preston Carter
Plot: Author Ben Mears returns to his childhood home of Jerusalem’s Lot in search of inspiration for his next book, only to discover that his hometown is being preyed upon by a bloodthirsty vampire, putting the lives of the townspeople in grave danger.
* * *
[Straker] I appreciate you coming, Mr. Snow.
As I finish my move from London and settle into your town, I need your help retrieving one final and crucial item.
A large crate will be arriving at the wharf at 6:00 sharp this evening.
You will be there upon its arrival and immediately load said crate into your truck.
Now, this crate is very heavy.
And what’s inside is very old.
So, you must take care as you move it.
It’s one of a kind.
Do you understand me, Mr. Snow?
So far.
After you pick up the shipment,
you will then deliver it to my new home
up there on the hill. Do you know it?
Uh… Yeah.
Everybody knows the Marsten House.
Once there, you are to open the bulkhead on the side of the Marsten House,
carry the crate into the cellar,
past the stairs, finally delivering it to the back.
I’ll be sure to leave a clearing for you.
The documents to secure the crate can be found in this envelope,
as well as your fee, of course.
[Hank] My grandma used to tell us stories about this place




just to set us straight.
She said Hubert Marsten worshipped Satan.
That’s why he shot his wife,
and killed himself,
They’re just stories.
We need to bring it down there.
In the cellar?
That’s what Mr. Straker said.
Fuck.
But I’m gonna back the truck up so we can get closer,
but you, uh… You go open it up.
You want me to open it?
Fuck.

[brakes squeal]
[Hank] What’d you say this was again?
[Royal] Paper said dresser.
[Hank] It must be some fucking dresser.

Could we set it down now?
I can’t see a goddamn thing, and I’m starting to lose my grip.

[Royal] Shit.




Christ, Hank!
I can’t see where I’m going!

It’s packed with dirt.
Why would a dresser be packed with dirt?
I don’t want to know.
Uh…
Pick it up, bring it into the back, all right? Let’s go.

[Hank] Jesus Christ.

and you’re on the WVAB radio. That was the latest from
from the Raspberry Brothers, that’s coming in at number two
on our Top 25 best songs of fall.
Those boys will be playing a Halloween special
down at Portland next month. Be sure to get your tickets, when they go on sale tomorrow.
Oh, Jesus!
You lost, son?
No, no. Um, sorry. I’m just sightseeing. I used to live around here.
Huh. Come back for a visit?
Yep.
[Parkins] What are you, some kind of an author?
Yeah.
Do me a favor, would you?
Don’t make any trouble while you’re here. Trouble makes work for me.
I don’t like to work.
You’ll get no trouble from me.
Just here for a little inspiration.
All right. You take care now.

I’m at the point in the story where the reader decides
whether or not she’ll ever finish it.

Can I help you with something?
Uh, a place for rent. You know, if you’ve got it.
Just you?
Yeah, it’s just me.

Hello! Hey! Larry Crockett.
Nice to meet you. Would you like some coffee?
Get a fresh pot going there, Susie. Will you?
I have trained her to make it just right. [clicks tongue]
Oh. [chuckles softly]




Uh, I’m okay on the coffee. Thank you.
Uh, I was just gonna ask your associate here…
Secretary.
Yeah, I think I saw someone in the Marsten House on the way in.
Is someone actually living there now?
Oh. Well, if you know about the Marsten House,
that should tell you I can pretty much sell anything.
It’s been sitting vacant for almost 40 years.
Who bought it? Um, some European fella. Wears these fancy suits.
He’s the one opening up that shop across the street.
How do you know about the Marsten House?
Are you from around here?
I grew up here till I was nine, yeah.
So maybe that’s why you look so familiar.
[Larry] Uh, what’d you say your name was?
Ben Mears.
[Larry] No, doesn’t spack.
Mr. Mears, are you looking to buy?
Nope, just need a place to rent.
Um, well, I’m sure you’re acquainted with the beauty of Maine.
Perhaps, as an investment…
Eva Miller has a couple rooms open.
[snaps fingers] She’s over on Railroad Street.
Eva Miller. Railroad.
Got it.

[Larry] Yeah, that went great, Susan.

[Eva] Yeah, you just jiggle it a little and it’ll work.
I keep asking Weasel to fix it.
Who knows, maybe one of these days he will.
[Weasel] Don’t count on it.
Here we are.
All right, I serve breakfast at 7:00 sharp if you want it.
Dinner’s usually on the table by 6:00.
Your laundry day is Tuesday.
And no guests.

That’s right. Yeah.

[boy 2] There’s no way he’s gonna get out of that.
Get your watch ready.
Let me know when to start.
[girl 1] Is he gonna do it?
[girl 2] I don’t think so.
[boy 2] No way.
Oh, shit.
[boy 4] Oh, no.
[boy 3] It’s Richie Boddin.
Here, let me help.
No, don’t. I can do this.
[Danny] Come on, Mark!
I got it.
[boy 2] Come on, man. Come on.
[children exclaiming]
[Danny] Jesus.
Welcome to the Lot, dillweed.
What are you looking at?
[Richie] Did you see his face?
No, stay down! Wait!
[girl 2] He’s getting back up.
[girl 3] Don’t do it!
[boy 2] No. Huh?
[girl 2] What is he doing?
Fucking goof!
[Richie grunts]
[children exclaiming]
[Richie groaning]
[screaming]
Say “uncle.”
Say “uncle” or I’ll break it!
[screaming]
[newscaster on radio] …are on different teams.
[Richie] Fuck you!
These two rookies don’t know nothing…
[children laughing]
[newscaster] …the kid got third in MVP voting as a rookie.
Once more unto the breach.
[screaming]
Okay! Okay! Uncle! Uncle, you win! Uncle.
Uncle, just get the fuck off of me!
Now say, “I’m a big, ugly turd.”
[Burke] Okay.
Say it!
Go back to your corners.
Then, decide which one of you is gonna tell me how this started.
[Richie] You better watch your back.
He’s new, Mr. Burke. He doesn’t know to stay away from Richie.
Quite a way to make a name for yourself, Mr. Petrie.
We can walk him home later, in case Richie gets any ideas, sir.
Richie Boddin having an idea is as likely as the Royal River running backwards.
And you, Mr. Petrie,
next time you tell a man to say uncle, and he does, you let him go.
We take people at their word here in the Lot.
Yes, sir.
[indistinct chatter]
[gentle music playing]
[bell tinkling]
[Straker sighs]
[Straker] And this will do nicely.
[Danny] Come on, let’s go!
[indistinct chatter continues]
[button clicking]
[door opens]
[Ann] He’s the nice, handsome man that comes
from a good family.
And I just don’t understand why you won’t give him another chance.
Because I didn’t want to give him a first chance, Mother.
Oh, but, Susan, honestly…
Shh!
[whispers] We’re in a library.
[in loud voice] Who are we discussing, ladies?
Floyd Tibbits perhaps?
Mind your business, Mabel.
You know, he’s right over there.
Floyd?
[Mabel] Ben Mears. The author.
You know, he actually lived here as a boy.
I don’t know if you’ll remember,
but there was that awful crash on Halliwell Road about 20 years ago.
Drunk driver. Oh, what was the family name?
Anyway, it turns out, the people that driver killed
were his parents.
Tragic. Who knows why he’d want to come back.
But he’s actually been spending a lot of time here.
I’m pretty sure he’s doing research for his next book.
Wonder what he finds so interesting about a little town like Salem’s Lot.
So, you ladies have any big plans for the weekend?
Well, as a matter…
[book thuds loudly]
Tonight, I’m going to the drive-in.
[Ann] Shh, Susan. Library, remember?
Now, what are you going on about?
Mabel asked what we’re doing for the weekend.
And I said, I’m going to the drive-in,
tonight.
[Ann] By yourself?
[Susan] Hmm.
[Ann] I think I should come with you. I’m gonna come with you.
[Susan] Mom, no.
[door closes]
[sinister music playing on speakers]
[woman screaming on speakers]
[woman] Help! [screaming]
[man] Stay back, Monster!
[monster yells]
[woman screaming]
Doesn’t all this stuff scare you?
[man] I will fell you with my mighty sword where you…
Stop, Ralph. You’ll break them.
It’s okay.
They’re pretty safe to touch once the glue sets.
See? Take a look.
[Ralphie] You’re not afraid of anything, huh?
Not even Richie Boddin.
Well,
I had to fight back.
Or else, he’d be on my case for the rest of the year.
Yeah, but,
what happens when he comes for you with the big kids?
I hear his brother has a switchblade.
If he comes at me again,
I’ll fight back then too. Running away makes it worse.
Oh, well, I hope he doesn’t kill you, so we can hang out some more.
Come on. We should go.
It’ll be getting dark soon, and you know what that means.
What’s it mean?
Ralphie’s just scared of the dark.
I am not.
[Mark] Maybe I can help.
Here, take this.
If you blow on it, it’ll help with your breathing and calm you down.
I learned that from Houdini.
He used to play one to help strengthen his lungs.
Who was Houdini?
He was the most famous and best magician of all time.
Neat!

That’s become like a rite of passage here.

Fancy seeing you here. [chuckles softly]
Hope you didn’t pay full price.
You can only see half the screen from way over here.
You’re practically in Yarmouth.
Yeah, I didn’t think it would be this full.
I haven’t been here since I was a kid.
Yeah, you can find the whole town here most nights it’s open.
Probably find out more about the town here than down at the library.
Mabel told you about my… My research?
Mabel tells everyone everything.
[people chattering]
[chuckles softly]
Uh…
The sun’s setting. The show will be starting soon.
Um, I have a secret spot,

Greetings, young masters.
Are you lost?
Would you like a lift to wherever it is you’re needed?
[Danny] Uh…
Um… No, thank you.
Come on, Ralph.
[Susan] Every car tells a story.
I’ll catch you up.
See Mr. Zimmerman?
In the Caddy over there?
[Ben] Yeah.
That isn’t Mrs. Zimmerman.
[both chuckle]
Over here,
Cory Bryant and Bonnie Sawyer. Breaking up for the 10th time.
[Ben] Oof.
That’s Father Callahan in the Ford,
in the corner. Quietly getting blitzed.
Let’s see,
who else…
What about you? What…
What’s your story?
[chuckles softly]
There’s no story here.
Come on.
You’re here. You work with what’s-his-name?
Only till I get my real estate license.
Then I’m striking out on my own.
See, that’s… That’s something.
You’ll run him right out of town.
Larry?
No. He can have the Lot.
I plan on moving back to Boston.
You were in Boston?
Yeah. Right after high school.
I only came back to help my dad when he got sick.
And then, he passed away last year, and my mom
has just been trying everything to make sure that I do not leave her.
That’s a sad story. I’m sorry.
Now you go. Why did you come back?
[exhales heavily] Well, uh,
Mable was right. I’m here for research.
What exactly, though, are you researching here?
Me.
I don’t really have much of a story, either.
I’ve always just written other people’s stories.
Uh…
My parents died in a car accident when I was nine.
So, I left here to live with extended family.
But it’s always felt like I ran away.
So…
My coming back to Salem’s Lot is like…
my way of reclaiming home.
You know?
[projector whirring]
[announcer] Good evening, folks, and welcome to the Jerusalem’s Lot Drive-In.
We want you have the best experience in modern cinema…
[Ralphie playing harmonica off-key]
[Danny] Will you stop with that?
[Ralphie] It helps me.
[Danny] I knew you’d get scared.
[Ralphie] Why do we have to go this way, anyway?
[Danny] I told you, I wanted to get away from that strange man.
[faint rustling]
[Ralphie grunts]
Ralph?
Ralph?
Ralph, stop!
Ralphie!
Ralph!
[muffled screaming]
[Ralphie breathing heavily]
[Straker grunts]
[Straker shushing]
[Straker] The master needs a sacrifice
before he can begin to transform your town into his image.
[Ralphie moaning]
[Straker] It is a great honor that I’m bestowing upon you.
[Ralphie grunting]
[muffled screaming continues]
[Straker] Oh, Master Barlow!
[Ralphie grunts]
[Ralphie whimpering]
[Straker] Lord of Flies!
[screaming]
It is I, Straker!
Your devoted servant!
I have returned, master!
I bring you a sacrifice!

[Father Callahan grunts softly]
Morning, Father.
Oh, well…
How bad did I get?
Three Hail Mary’s. You should be fine.
Look, I tried to take you back to the rectory,
but you was bent on me bringing you here.
You said it was… Oh, hell, what did you say?
Atonement, probably.
Right, atonement.
Exactly. Oh, thank God, I’m a Methodist.
Uh, your car is around back.
I had Nolly drive it in.
[groans softly]
Oh, and, um…
You feeling up to it later, you might want to drop in on the Glicks.
The youngest boy is missing. They’re forming a search party.
Yeah. Yeah, it’s quite a world we got here.
Only getting worse if you ask me.
[sighs heavily] What are we supposed to do about it, Constable?
Isn’t that the question we need to ask ourselves?
[Parkins] Mmm.
I ask myself plenty.
All answers point to retirement.
It’s just the Methodist in you.
[chuckles softly]
Only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
Well, you see, that’s just it.
You see any good men around here lately, Father?
Ralph?
Is Ralphie in there?
Anything?
[exhales shakily]
[Floyd] Go back to New York, asshole.
Nobody wants your help here.
That’s Floyd Tibbits. He has a thing for Susie Norton.
Word gets around quick here.
[grunts softly]
Matt Burke. School teacher.
You’re Ben Mears, the author.
I’ve enjoyed your books. They’re better than what some critics suggest.
You mind calling my publisher, telling him that?
[Burke chuckles]
If you don’t mind coming around the school and talking with the kids,
I know they’d love to meet a real-life writer.
Sure, yeah.
Or maybe I could do some good, push them into finance.
It’s not just Floyd with the funny looks, is it?
I mean, I wouldn’t blame ’em if they all had a thing for Susan.
It’s simple math. You’re new in town,
local boy has just gone missing.
I’m surprised that Parkins hasn’t talked to you yet.
Well, he did.
But it was a short conversation though,
considering I had someone who could vouch for my whereabouts,
at the time of the disappearance. [grunts softly]
Speaking of…
Hi.
I heard Parkins might stop the search soon.
The cold reality is settling in.
[indistinct police radio chatter]
It’s a shame the brother doesn’t remember anything.
Sometimes things happen that are so terrible,
your brain won’t let you remember.
Not any time soon anyway.
Research tell you that or experience?
[electronic organ music playing]
[vehicle approaching]
[Susan] Oh, my God.
So embarrassing.
Maybe she read my books.
[both chuckle]
It isn’t you. It’s…
Well, it is you.
But only because you’re an outsider.
She thinks that we will run off together or something,
and never look back.
Sounds kinda nice, actually.
[insects chittering]

Ralphie?

Ralphie!

Ralph?

[soft rustling]
[seesaw creaking]
[shakily] Ralphie?
[seesaw creaking]
Ralph?
[Danny screaming]
Danny?
I feel sick.
[door opens]
It’s pernicious anemia.
It’s a vitamin-B deficiency that prohibits the body from making more red blood cells.
Red cell count in a boy Danny’s age should be around 80-85%.
Right now, Danny is at 40.
[monitors beeping]
Even with the transfusions, it’s still going down.
All we can do is wait and see.
[Danny breathing weakly]
Danny! Danny, what is it?
[groans weakly]
Thirsty,
Thirsty? Thirsty. Good.
Yes. Okay.
Nurse! Nurse! Water!
My son, he’s awake.
[screaming]
[nurse] Mrs. Glick, what is it?
Oh, my God!
[birds chirping]
[church bells tolling]
Go on, Mike.
Go.
Days like today are where it’s earned.
No sooner did they lose one son, now this.
[Mike exhales]
[muffled crying, sniffling]
[Father Callahan] “Most merciful God whose wisdom is beyond our understanding,
deal graciously with this family in their time of grief.”
[Marjorie sobbing]
“Surround them with your love, so they may not be overwhelmed by their loss,
but have confidence in your goodness, and strength in the days to come.”
[Marjorie continues sobbing]
“We ask this in faith, Lord, hear our prayer.”
[inhales sharply]
Oh, shit.
[grunts softly]
Oh, hell.
[dirt crunching under shovel]
[dogs barking in distance]

[Danny] Help!
Help, help!
Oh, shit.
Let me out! Please! Let me out!
Uh, hold on.
[thudding continues]
Let me out, please! Help!
Hold on. I’m coming, okay.
I’m not dead, I’m alive. Help me! Please!
I’m coming. Hold on.
[Mike grunting softly]
[grunting]
[Mike gasps]
[yells]
[Mike screams]
[Burke] Okay.
We have time for one last question.
Go ahead, Miss…
Becky Werts. Thank you.
So, are you and Miss Norton dating?
Don’t answer that.
[children laughing]
I take it you’re Mabel’s daughter?
[school bell ringing]
Thanks, Ben.
I hope that didn’t hurt too much.
I have the sudden need to call every teacher I ever had and apologize.
[Burke chuckles]
How are the kids dealing with the Glick news?
Same way the town is.
If they don’t talk about it, maybe it’s not happening.
[door creaking]
[bartender] Here you go.
[jukebox clicking]
[man humming on jukebox]
[light music playing]
[song playing faintly on jukebox]
Mike?
[Mike breathing raspily]
Hey.
Mike.
You all right?
You don’t look so good, Mike.
[Mike] Uh…
Yeah, I think I’m sick with something. [sniffles]
How long you been sick?
[Mike exhales]
I’m not sure.
I passed out after a funeral,
and I’m not sure how long I was out.
Danny Glick’s funeral?
Yeah, I can’t remember.
You can’t remember anything?
Even the slightest of details?
I remember eyes.
Whose eyes?
[mumbles incoherently]
What is it, Mike?
[gasps]
[soft rock music playing on jukebox]
I’m real scared, Mr. Burke.
I don’t want to go home.
Dr. Cody will be gone by now.
But I want to take you to see her in the morning, all right?
You can stay with me till then. Sound good?
Thank you.
Thank you for inviting me over.
I feel better already.
Good.
Here.
Take these.
Oh.
[breathing raspily]
Uh…
Where did you get those marks, Mike?
On your neck.
[gasps]
I don’t really know.
Is everything all right, Mr. Burke?
[match strikes]
[radio host] Folks, it’s just about game time here
in the beautiful city of Cincinnati, Ohio.
As the umpire takes the field,
we got Sammy McDonald of the American League behind the plate.
[commentary continues indistinctly]
You’re in for a good one tonight.
This series is tied up at two games apiece.
The Sox blew the doors off of Cincinnati…
[commentary continues indistinctly]
[knocking at door]
[Danny, whispering] Let me in.
[window opens]
[objects clattering]
[Ben] Yeah. Yeah, just a minute.
Matt Burke is downstairs, he’s asking for you.
And he seems disturbed.
Okay. Um…
Yeah. I’ll be right down.
Good evening, Susan.
Hi, Eva.
Matt?
Do you have a cross of any kind or a Saint Christopher’s medallion?
What’s going on, Matt?
I need you both to come with me. We can talk about it once we’re there.
That’s where I saw it go in. The power must have gone out.
The lights were on when I left.
I know how it sounds.
The idea that Mike Ryerson is
some kind of, Jesus, creature of the night.
It does sound…
Crazy?
Ben?
[door creaking]
[Burke] Mike?
I don’t think he’s breathing.
Shut the window.
Christ! He’s cold.
They aren’t there, are they?
The marks.
According to folklore, they disappear after death,
and then the transformation can take anywhere from minutes to days.
What is it?
What do I do?
Let the machinery takeover.
Call Parkins. Tell him…
you saw Mike down at Dell’s.
He didn’t look so good. So you brought him back here,
and he died in his sleep.
Just… don’t say a word about…
Vampires?
Well?
Well, he’s definitely dead.
Amen.
Oh.
I knew Nolly’d be good for something.
He’s not much of a deputy,
but he’s a hell of an electrician.
What was it the Glick boy died from again, Doctor?
Perspicuous… It was Persimmons…
Pernicious anemia.
Yeah.
It’s like when your body can’t make blood fast enough.
Something like that, isn’t it?
Yeah, Matt.
Something like that.
[Parkins] Well, what do you…
You think it’s some kind of connection here?
I don’t see why there would be.
It’s not a disease you can catch.
Huh.
[Susan sighs]
What’s your opinion, Doctor?
I’ll let you know when I have one.
[knocking at window]
[Danny] Mark.
Mark.
Let me in.
[banging]
The window, Mark. He commands it.
Open the window, Mark.
Master Barlow wants to meet you, Mark.
[Danny exhales raspily]
[sizzling]
[screams]
I’ll set you free, Danny.
You have my word.
Okay.
Crosses.
They can hypnotize.
[scribbling]
No direct sunlight.
What else?
Let’s see…
Have to stay in the shadows.
Guess I gotta go kill Barlow.
[faint rattling]
[sports commentary playing faintly on radio]
[faint creaking]

[Mike breathing raspily]
Mike?
[Mike screeches]

[Burke panting]
[Mike breathing raspily]
[wind howling]
[lock clicks]
[Mike growls]
[grunts]
[groaning]
[Mike] Stop fighting and join us.
[groaning]
No.
[grunting]
[Mike breathing raspily]
Master Barlow wants to meet you, Mr. Burke.
Mike, please.
[yells]
[screeching]
I revoke my invitation!
[growling]
Get out!
[panting]
[indistinct chatter]
Hear the latest?
Try me.
That Glick kid? His mom was found dead this morning.
Did they bring her here?
Brought her straight out to Green’s Mortuary.
All the way out there?
Why didn’t they bring her to Foreman’s in town?
No one can get a hold of Foreman.
It’s been hard to get a hold of anybody over in the Lot these days.
Is Mike Ryerson’s body still downstairs?
Unless it got up and walked out last night.
This is some shit.
Ah, for fuck’s sake!
Matt! Hey! Hey! Matt?
Oh, Christ, my head.
No. Don’t move yet.
We need to make sure you’re okay, then we can talk.
About what?
Marjorie Glick is dead and Mike Ryerson’s corpse is missing.
You have any idea why?
[fire crackling]
[Matt] The power of faith, wooden stakes, crosses,
white roses, garlic,
all are supposed to be deterrents for vampires.
Sounds like silly superstitions to me.
Maybe. [winces]
Maybe so, but,
when I called Linda’s Flowers over in Cumberland earlier,
and asked for white roses,
they said they were all sold out.
Said some well-dressed man came in last week and bought ’em all up.
Straker.
[Burke] He must do Barlow’s bidding during the day.
And you think the Glick boys are all caught up in this, too?
I think the first boy was a sacrifice,
to consecrate the grounds for Barlow’s arrival.
The second boy…
Well, Mike made it sound like he was attacked after Danny’s funeral.
There is one way we can find out for certain if Danny’s still dead.
How?
You want to exhume Danny Glick?
Don’t you?
No! No, I don’t!
I don’t want to do any of this.
You’re sitting there with a book about vampires in your hand,
and the only evidence I have is…
Is a missing body.
It’s missing for a reason.
Mike Ryerson attacked me here last night.
That’s why he’s missing, because he’s a fucking vampire!
What about the mother?
[Ben] What mother?
Marjorie Glick. Danny’s mother.
We don’t need to exhume the boy,
when the mother is laid up over there at Green’s Mortuary.
Maury said, “Looks like she died the same way as Danny.”
We could pay her a visit.
And do what?
Wait till night comes.
We’ll go.
You three go. There’s still some research I need to do.
[Ben] Wait. More research?
You seem to know all that you need to about vampires, Matt.
Yes, but I know very little about Barlow and Straker.
I intend to remedy that.
[gentle dance music playing]
[Ann and Straker laughing]
[Ann] So, when can I meet this Mr. Barlow?
[Ann] Ooh! [laughing]
[grunting]
[gasps]
Out.
Now.
They got Danny.
I said I’d help him. I gave my word.
Mr. Petrie, you have no idea what you’re getting yourself into here.
Yes, I do. They’re vampires.
I can prove it.
You don’t have to.
You know?
Yes.
[thudding]
[Burke and Mark grunting]
[match striking]
Stay close.
We need another way out of here.
[rattling]
[rattling]
[objects clattering]
Damn it! No way up. No stairs!
I’ll boost you up. Come on. Let’s go.
Okay.
Higher. I can’t reach it.
Go.
[Burke] Up.
[grunting]
Hurry up, Mark.
[Mark] Door’s locked. It won’t open.
[Burke] Hurry! Mark, the light, get the light.
[switch clicks]
[snarling]
[Burke screaming]
[Mark screams]
Any…
[clears throat]
Anything?
No.
I doubt if vampires rise at almanac sunset anyway.
If vampires exist at all, that is.
And what if she does rise?
What do you mean?
How will we protect ourselves?
[gasps softly]
[Marjorie] Danny?
Oh, hell!
Danny, where are you?
What do we do?
[Dr. Cody] I’ll make a cross with these.
Danny?
Danny?
It’s not working.
[Marjorie] Answer me.
This is not working!
[Susan] Tape.
Tape?
To bind it.
We need to bind the cross.
In my bag. There’s some in there.
[Marjorie] Danny, answer me.
In my bag!
[Ben] Here. Let me see it!
Here.
[Susan] Oh, God.
[Dr. Cody] Tape it!
Susan, come on, hurry!
[Susan] It’s not working.
[Ben] Tape it. Come on.
It’s not working!
[Ben] Fuck.
[Susan] Shit!
Bless it.
What?
I don’t know!
You’re the writer. Think of something.
Bless it!
Uh… [sputtering] In…
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy…
Shit, it’s glowing!
Bless this cross and… And…
[Marjorie giggling]
And…
And?
The Lord. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
[all] He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness!
[Marjorie screaming]
Fuck!
[Dr. Cody] Get her off!
Get off me! Get off!
[Marjorie snarling]
[Susan] The Lord is my Shepherd.
I shall not want. He restoreth my soul.
[Dr. Cody] No!
No! Get her!
Get off! Get off of me!
[Ben grunting]
Get off me!
Fuck! No!
Ben!
Oh, Jesus! There’s no blood! There is no blood!
[Marjorie laughing]
[in a demonic voice] There will be no one left!
Even now your circle is smaller.
[Dr. Cody] No!
[screams]
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.
[sizzling]
[Marjorie screams]
[Dr. Cody whimpering]
Get my bag! Get my bag!
[moans] God!
Open that!
Here! Here!
Okay. Come on.
[Susan] What is it?
[Ben] Here.
It’s a rabies shot.
[Susan] A rabies shot?
[cries out in pain]
It works for animal bites if you do it quick.
[Susan] Okay.
Right here. See the vein? Go!
[Susan] Yeah.
[Dr. Cody groans]
Get the cross.
Put it… Put the cross on me.
In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit,
bless this cross, and…
[Dr. Cody whimpering]
[gasping]
Thank God.
[whimpering]
[all panting]
[Dr. Cody exclaims]
Tomorrow, we go to the authorities.
Parkins?
No.
Father Callahan. The church.
Crosses, holy water, prayer…
he might be able to help somehow.
[cross clatters]
But first, let’s go find Matt.
Tell him he was right.
Stay in the car.
What? Why?
Because there are vampires on the roof of Matt’s house.
Look slowly.
[Susan] What do we do?
Matt could be inside and need our help.
[sighs] We’re too late.
They got him.
“Even now, your circle is smaller.”
That’s what she meant.
[Susan] Matt, Mike, The Glicks.
Who knows how many others?
Go.
[birds chirping]
[Mark straining]
[continues straining]
[Straker] Rise and shine, young master!
There’s much to celebrate.
Your town has been most welcoming to us…
[Mark grunts]
Just as Hubert Marsten promised my Barlow long ago.
Oh, he looks forward to meeting you tonight.
He’s most capable of kindness.
It’s only gonna be a little sting and then…
nothing.
[groaning]
No.
No!
[clanging]
[birds chirping, cawing]
[wood creaks]
You do know lying is a sin, right?
Haven’t you noticed anything out of the ordinary in the Lot recently?
[scoffs]
The mortality rate has been rather high in the Lot lately, Father.
Medically speaking, of course.
I’m in the business of the supernatural.
In my youth, I had my own unusual experiences.
So, you have to do a lot less to convince someone like me.
[exhales]
You know, a younger priest wouldn’t have any issue at all with this.
They view the trappings of the church as symbolic, rather than practical.
But I’m not young anymore.
And I am probably a poor excuse for a priest at this point.
But I still believe in the awesome power of the church.
It’s a force.
And one does not set that force in motion lightly.
Yes?
Can I help you?
Mr. Burke.
He’s one of them now.
I’m sorry, what? One of who?
One of the vampires.
I’m gonna go after them. I just need to get some supplies.
Barlow, I think he’s the head vampire.
I didn’t get him, but I got his servant, Straker.
But you’re, like, what? 11?
And three-quarters.
You killed Straker?
I had to.
It was the only way I could get out.
Wait.
Show me where this happened.
[birds chirping]
[birds cawing]
[floorboards creaking]
[Father Callahan] Hello?
Son.
Where’s the body?
[Dr. Cody sighs]
[Father Callahan shudders]
Okay, fine. I’ll go.
[loud thud]
[creaking]
There’s no stairs.
That’s where I saw Barlow get Mr. Burke.
[Susan] There’s a ladder outside.
[Ben sighs]
[Ben] Get your stakes and crosses ready.
[water dripping]
[Ben] See anything?
[faint rumbling]
[water continues dripping]
[Barlow exhaling]
[Susan] Is anyone else hearing this?
[glassware clattering]
[Barlow exhaling]
[snarling]
Shit! I missed. Go! Run! Run!
[Father Callahan] Mark, go! Come on. Go.
[Burke] Barlow’s coming for you,
your families, tonight!
[snarling]
Come sleep like the dead.
[Susan] Ben!
[Burke screaming]
Here. It has to be through his heart.
[Burke growling]
I’m sorry, Matt.
Come on, we need to go to Parkins. See what he knows.
I don’t expect him to help us, but maybe he’ll reach out to someone who will.
My parents! Barlow’s coming for them tonight!
All right, we need to find them somewhere safe.
The church.
Are they really gonna believe what it is we have to tell them?
Well, maybe they will if it’s coming from me.
I’ll go with Mark and we’ll talk to them.
I need to warn my mom.
Get her to the church before night comes.
Now that we know Barlow’s been watching us.
All right. I’ll go with you.
Dr. Cody, you go see Parkins.
[Dr. Cody] Okay. Warn anyone else you see.
Wait. Shouldn’t we all stay together?
There’s no time. Half hour to sunset.
Oh, God! Well, let’s make sure we’re all at the church by sundown.
It’s, uh… It’s protected soil. We’ll be safe there tonight.
Come on, let’s go.
[birds cawing]
[Parkins] Ah! What’s that?
Where you going, Parkins?
Out.
Out where?
Look, I don’t want to hear about it.
I don’t want to hear any of it.
Hear what?
Vampires.
Like in all ’em comic books down at Spencer’s,
I don’t want to hear it.
Well, you need to hear it because something needs to be done about it.
I am doing something.
I’m leaving the Lot. And you should, too.
You coward!
This town is still alive and you’re running away.
You’re supposed to be protecting it.
It’s not alive, Doctor.
That’s why he came here.
Barlow.
It’s dead. Just like him.
That’s why he could take over like that.
And the whole country’s going the same way, too.
You just watch.
You’re giving up!
I’m surviving. That’s what I’m doing.
You’d better get going, Doc.
Things have gone bad in the Lot now.
[engine starting]
[door creaks open]
[Susan] Mom! Mom, are you here?
Susan?
Mom?
We need to leave.
Oh, Susan.
Oh, I have the most wonderful news.
I don’t want him here.
Get him out of here now.
Okay, be quick.
What’s the news, Mom?
I met an incredible man.
He promised he’d take care of us, Susie,
and I said, “I’d do whatever it takes.”
He asked me to serve him, and I promised to
protect him during the day while he sleeps.
Mom.
And he just…
Who, Mom?
He owns the new antique store in town.
Barlow.
I need you to listen to me. We’re in…
[Susan gasping]
[flesh squelching]
[Ben] No! Susan!
You get your hands off my daughter!
No! No! Don’t leave! Don’t leave!
Bring her back!
[gun cocks]
You bring my daughter back here!
[Henry] I left a message at the station. He’ll probably be here soon.
We need to get to the church.
Mark, go upstairs to your room. Let the adults finish talking.
No, Dad, we need to leave.
Mark!
He’s gonna come for you!
I understand how all of this must sound to you.
He’s gonna come for Mom, for me, for everyone.
Mark, upstairs now!
There are others that you can talk to,
who’ve seen the same things that we’ve seen.
[knock on door]
Dad, wait!
Enough, Mark.
Mr. Petrie? No, Mr. Petrie, don’t!
Don’t go out there.
[Henry] Who’s there?
Mark.
Mom!
[Father Callahan] Oh, God! It’s evil.
[Mark] Help her!
[Mark] No!
[snarls]
In the name of God,
I command you to…
[Mark] Dad!
[snarling]
Oh, God.
Son!
Mark, run! Run! Run!
Get back! I am a priest.
[Barlow laughing]
Are you?
Sad to see a man’s faith fail.
[low growling]
[Father Callahan screaming]
[Mark panting]
[vampire kid 1] Mark.
[vampire kid 2] Play with us.
[vampires snarling]
[vampire kid 3] We just wanna play with you, Mark.
[vampire laughing]
[snarling]
[vampire kid 4] Come on, Mark. Let us in.
[Mark grunting]
[vampire kid 5] Come on, Mark.
[vampire kid 6] Come on, Mark. Let us in.
[vampire kid 7] Mark, come play with us.
You can be just like us.
[vampires banging]
[vampires hissing and laughing]
[vampire kid 1] Mark!
[vampire kid 2] Mark!
Mark!
Hang on, Susan.
[horn blaring]
[horn blaring]
Help her! She’s been bit.
God!
[Susan howling]
[Ben grunting]
[groaning]
[Ben] Get the shot!
It’s okay, it’s okay.
Hey, hey, hey!
You’re gonna be okay.
Listen to me.
[growling]
Susan, you’re gonna be all right.
Help her, goddamn it! Get the shot!
Susan!
She’s reacting to holy ground.
It’s too late for her.
No, no, no! Help her!
It’s okay. Hey, Susan.
Look at me. It’s okay.
It’s me.
There’s only one way to help her now, Ben.
What? What are you…
No!
No, are you fucking kidding me?
Just try, God damn it!
[snarling]
Just try!
[Ben grunting]
[Dr. Cody] Ben!
Susan!
No!
[panting]
Ben, it’s not safe!
[wind howling]
[Ben] No…
[vampires snarling]
[vampire shrieks]
[Dr. Cody] Here!
Catch!
[vampire snarls]
[flesh squelching]
[vampire groans]
[Dr. Cody exclaims]
[Ben grunts]
[gasping softly]
[Ben gasping]
[vampires hissing and snarling]
[Ben grunting]
[Dr. Cody grunting]
Back off! Come on.
[vampires snarling]
Back off!
Get back!
[groaning] Come on.
You all right?
Susan’s mom,
she’s Barlow’s new servant.
[gasping, grunting]
Mark? Father Callahan?
What about the sheriff?
[vampires growling outside]
He wasn’t much help.
[water dripping]
[static buzzing]
Jesus.
He left a note.
Mark?
At least, he’s alive. For now.
What’d he say?
He’s going to kill Barlow.
Ow.
[winces]
[snarling]
[grunts]
[Danny grunting]
I gave you my word, Danny.
[vehicle approaching]
Mark! Oh!
Are you okay?
Did you find him?
No.
Well, it looks like you found some.
Just one. And he found me.
Rest are all hiding.
I checked most everywhere.
Okay.
Okay, let’s get out of here, find somewhere safe.
No!
We need to fight back.
Barlow killed my parents.
He started with Salem’s, and then who knows?
If we don’t do it now, they’ll come for us eventually.
Maybe they already moved on, you said so yourself, you couldn’t find any…
No.
I don’t think it works that way.
They’re here.
Somewhere.
Just has to be a big enough place for the whole town.
[Ben] You two notice anything else missing?
No cars.
How many of those stakes you got?
[tires screech]
You really think Barlow’s here?
I think they’re all here.
[Dr. Cody] Ben, where you going?
It’s gonna get dark soon!
[keys jangling]
[panting]
Oh, sweet Jesus.
They’re not cars, they’re coffins.
No, I can’t do that.
It’s not Susan, Ben.
It’s just something that looks like her.
I can do it if it makes it easier.
Yeah.
[Dr. Cody breathing heavily]
[gunshot]
[Ben] No! Dr. Cody!
Get away from my daughter!
[Mark] Run, let’s go.
[Ann] Barlow told me you’d come for her.
[panting]
[grunting]
[panting]
[gun cocking]
Mark!
I’m okay! Go find Barlow!
[car doors thudding]
[vampires growling]
[snarls]
[gun cocks]
[Ben] Mark, get to the sunlight!
Go, go, go!
[snarling]
[Ben grunting] No!
Mark, run!
[vampire snarls]
Run, Mark, run!
[grunting, gasping]
[vampires snarling]
[grunting]
[engine starts]
[Ben grunting]
[vampires shrieking]
You goddamn outsiders!
[gun firing]
[growling]
[Ben panting]
[vampire shrieking]
[panting]
[panting]
Thanks.
You okay?
No.
Are you?
[exhales sharply] No.
Sun’s almost down.
It’s just you and me, Mark.
It’s gonna be our last chance to kill Barlow before he moves on to another town.
There has to be somewhere big enough for a coffin.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
Shadows, remember?
Here.
[Ben grunting]
[Mark] Here, let me help.
Get ready.
[grunting]
[both grunting]
I got to find something to open it with.
Ben!
Hurry!
[both grunting]
Come on!
[Mark] Fuck!
[panting]
[both grunting]
Come on. Come on.
[growls]
[Mark] No!
[Mark grunts]
[snarling]
Susan.
It’s me.
Let go, Ben.
Don’t do this.
[snarling]
[grunting]
[Susan growls]
[Ben grunts]
[announcer on speakers] Good evening, folks,
and welcome to the Jerusalem’s Lot drive-in.
[announcer continues indistinctly]

Yeah.
What do we do now?

Genre: Biography, Drama, History

Director: Margarethe von Trotta

Writers: Pamela Katz, Margarethe von Trotta

Stars: Barbara Sukowa, Axel Milberg, Janet McTeer
Plot: In 1961, the noted German-American philosopher of Jewish origin, Hannah Arendt, gets to report on the trial of the notorious Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann. While observing the legal proceedings, Arendt concludes that Eichmann was not a monster, but an ordinary man who had thoughtlessly buried his conscience through his obedience to the Nazi regime and its ideology. Arendt’s expansion of this idea, presented in her articles for The New Yorker, would create her concept of ‘the banality of evil’ that she thought even sucked in some Jewish leaders of the era into unwittingly participating in the Holocaust. The result is a bitter public controversy in which Arendt is accused of blaming the Holocaust’s victims. Now that strong willed intellectual is forced to defend her ideas in a struggle that will exact a heavy personal cost.
* * *
[Crickets Chirping]
[Man Screaming]
[Woman] But, Hannah, how can you defend him?
[German Accent] But I’m not defending him.
You can hardly forget that your husband is my friend because of you.
And I don’t throw my friends away so quickly.
No matter what happens, even if Jim were killed in an airplane crash, I would never, ever go back to Bowden.
That’s clear.
And poor Bowden knows absolutely that he cannot prevent you from loving another man.
He is not stupid. [Phone Ringing]
Then why is he trying to prevent our divorce?
Because, under such circumstances, it’s only natural… that people imagineor at least hope- to have some possibility of power.
[In German] Hans Jonas is on the phone.
[In German] Not now, later. I’ll call him back.
Oh, Mary, they are beautiful. Thank you.
[Sighs]
[Phone Rings] I don’t know how you can believe anything he says these days.
Well, you trusted him enough to be married with him for 15 years.
I never trusted him.
It’s Professor Miller calling from Connecticut. He said it’s urgent.
He has some questions about your syllabus. Phone appointment-
tomorrow, please.




And unplug that phone.
Look, Mary, either you are willing to take men as they are, or you must live alone.
You won’t change Jim either.
I don’t want to change Jim. He’s perfect.
Perfect? [German]
The men in your novels are not perfect.
Why do you expect the real ones to be any better?
That was Heinrich. [Gasps] Oh, no.
That’s the one phone call I would have taken.
He said not to disturb you when your darling Mary is here.
When will he be home?
He’s spending the night up there.
He has to meet a student early in the morning.
[Sighs]
[In German] Thanks, Lotte.
No student meets early in the morning.
Mary, don’t start. I would be far too jealous for your charming Heinrich.
It’s fine. Well, I suppose we can’t all be wild Berliners like you.
[Laughs] [Phone Rings]
Wild because we don’t marry all our lovers?
Oh, I didn’t marry all of them.
But almost.
[Mary Chuckles]
[Hannah Chuckles]
[Dog Barking]




[Siren Wailing In Distance]
[Door Opens]
[In German] I couldn’t sleep at all last night.
We don’t have to talk about it right away.
Haven’t you read the newspaper?
From beginning to end, Frau Professor.
They want his trial to be in Jerusalem!
Why else would the Mossad have kidnapped him?
You think that’s right?
They should have shot him on the spot in Buenos Aires.
But then of course…
[In English] You forgot to say hello.
Hello.
The investigation has revealed… that Adolf Eichmann’s escape from Germany to South America… was made possible with a Red Cross passport that the Vatican helped him obtain.
No! The pope would never help a Nazi escape. [Chuckles]
No, he helped him because he was such a good Catholic.
But God didn’t let him get away.
God didn’t. But the Germans did.
You’ll see. They won’t try to extradite him.
The former SS officer… followed what was secretly known in espionage circles as the ratline.
Eichmann received his forged identification and passport in Genoa, and then he boarded an Italian ship to Buenos Aires.
“You will perhaps understand why I want to attend Eichmann’s trial. I left Germany in 1933, and I missed Nuremberg. I never saw a Nazi”-
Um-Oh, wait.
“I never saw ‘these people’ in the flesh”?
“People in the flesh.”




[In German] I think that’s better. Better, yes.
Isn’t it incredible that the Hannah Arendt is offering to report for us?
It would be a privilege to have a German-Jewish émigré of such high standing cover the trial.
There’s no doubt about that. Who is she to be offering?
She should be begging to write for the New Yorker, like everyone else.
Frances, she wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism.
Catchy title.
One of the most important books of the 20th century.
Read it. Uh-oh.
She’s not one of those European philosophers, is she?
She was the first person to write about the Third Reich in the context of Western civilization.
It was brilliant, but abstract.
I understand why she wants to go.
Philosophers don’t make deadlines.
Call now.
Do it.
[In German] Do you really have to do this?
You remember how shocked we were when we heard the awful news from Europe…
How destroyed you were?
[Knife Clinks]
I’d never forgive myself if I didn’t take this opportunity.
You told everyone how smart and brave I was to escape from Gurs.
And so you were, my love.
Many women stayed for fear their husbands wouldn’t find them if they left the camp.
I’d have found you anywhere.




Maybe not.
While it was still summer and warm… we hoped it would soon be over.
But then…
The waiting…
More and more women let themselves go, stopped combing their hair…
Stopped washing themselves.
Just lay there on their straw sacks.
I tried to encourage them.
Sometimes I was strict, sometimes friendly.
But then, one evening… it had rained all day and the straw sacks were falling apart.
I suddenly lost my courage.
I was so tired.
So tired… that I wanted to leave the world that I so loved.
And in that instant… I saw you in front of me.
How you’d look for me, and… not find me.
Now do you understand why I don’t want you to go?
Summis cum gratulationibus.
[In German] Hannah… great! You asked them?
And they just said yes?
Yes. Simple as that.
Everything’s simple for a genius.
Don’t exaggerate.
[In English] I hope you’re still teaching next term.
You will hear all about that when the tribe comes over.
[In German] You know, I almost dread this trip. I wish I could accompany you.
Oh Hans, that would be so nice.
[Chattering]
Need a light, Mrs. Arendt?
Oh. Thank you. You’re very welcome.
[Chattering]
[Siren Wailing In Distance]
[Chattering]
Nixon’s usually an unrepentant bulldog, but he’s lost his nerve.
He’s like a frightened schoolboy wanting to be liked.
He’s even trying to get Kennedy’s approval.
Nixon is a liar. It’s a strategy. He only cares about his career.
That’s why he’s going to win.
No. Nixon calculates.
But Kennedy is young and handsome and inspiring, and that is what matters when the ships are down.
“Chips.” Hannah, “chips,” not “ships.”
[Doorbell Rings] Oh, that must be Hans and Lore.
[In German] All right then: “chips.” [Mary Chuckles]
English can only be a second-rate fiddle for us.
If you want to hear Hannah play her Stradivarius, you should learn German.
She asked me to correct her.
[Hannah] Ah, at last!
Impossible. Must have been someone else.
[In German] Our train was late. Of course.
We know that excuse.
Coats off. Everyone’s here.




Great that you made it.
Meet the latest member of the tribe. Professor Miller, Hans and Lore Jonas.
Such a pleasure to finally meet you. Professor Miller, it’s an honor.
Hannah tells me you’re her oldest and dearest friend.
The oldest for sure, but not the dearest.
Oh, Heinrich is much older than me. And much better looking.
[Miller] Did you already know each other back in Germany?
Thomas, I said “old friend.” In Europe that means we met more than 10 minutes ago.
They met in the ’20s as students of Heidegger, the Hosenmatz philosopher.
[In German] Don’t say my name in the same breath as that Nazi.
Not here, Hans!
So, you were all students of the confounding Martin Heidegger.
Oh, I didn’t even finish high school.
But aren’t you a professor at Bard?
Original thinkers don’t need degrees, Professor Miller.
[Chuckles]
To Hannah, in honor of her trip to Jerusalem.
Oh, thank you, Hans.
[In German] It’s not a vacation, Hans.
Lotte, champagne.
[Miller] So I heard so much about you.
[Miller] I am honored that a colleague from my university… has this great opportunity to be an eyewitness to history.
We’ll miss you. Oh, thank you.
[Man] Yes, really.
Thank you.
It is just wonderful, Hannah, that you, one of us, will be present for this great trial.
[In German] This is not a grand trial. It’s illegal.
The kidnapping by the Israeli secret service was illegal!
Israel has a sacred right to try a Nazi for crimes against the Jewish people.
Sacred right? Hans, you’re meshugga.
But most of the survivors live there.
[Hans] Precisely.
And they want to see this criminal face to face.
Face to face! Excuse me.
They’ll all be dragged into court!
They’ll be witnesses.
It’ll take years. This trial…
So much smoke! [Groans]
Do you understand anything? I thought you were the German speaker.
Well, I can read it perfectly, but they’re speaking so fast.
The State of Israel didn’t even exist back then.
Unfortunately.
Or they’d have declared war on Hitler like England and France.
But nevertheless, we were there!
We did our duty and volunteered for the British Army to fight the Nazis.
We were in the Jewish Brigade in ’44.
Me and many brave men from Israel.
They know that.
Heinrich doesn’t know what it means to take up arms to defend his convictions.
He had to emigrate because of them!




So did many others. Doesn’t mean much.
No one doubts your bravery, Hans.
Hannah always says she admired you as a soldier.
Not just as a soldier.
[Mary] Lotte!
Eichmann should have been tried in Nuremberg, but he escaped.
That makes him an outlaw, a pirate. Tell us what they’re saying.
I’m sure you’d prefer to hear it from Hannah.
[German Continues]
So he should be tried by an international court.
[Heinrich] No such thing.
Precisely!
If the case proceeds as you predict…
He’s just one of those passionate ex-communists from Berlin.
Jewish? No.
But he followed Rosa Luxemburg to the end.
Oh, so of course that’s better than a PhD. [Chuckles]
You can’t put history on trial. You can only try one man.
[Hans] Indeed. One man on trial. For murder.
Strange pair.
[Heinrich] Yes. For murder.
They’re fantastic. The happiest married couple in the world.
[Heinrich] And that has to be proven…
Whatever you’re saying, I agree with all of you.
Everybody, English now. Please.
[Heinrich] Sorry, Mary.
[Mary Chuckling] Good health.
[In German] See you soon.
Adieu, Charlotte.
Adieu.
Thank you, dear. See you soon.
[Hannah] We were too hard on Hans. Tell him I’m sorry.
You say that every time.
I know.
See you on campus.
Oh, it was great having you, Thomas. Bye.
Bye… Take care now in that awful storm.
It’s terrible.
[Laughing] It’s so much fun to light a fire under Hans’ sacred little behind.
Especially as he’s so happy to send you to hell!
Oh… you.
[Footsteps Marching]
[Marching Continues]
[Whispers] Hannah!
Here:
In his inaugural speech, he thanked the Führer.
PARTY MEMBER HEIDEGGER…
Then they sang the Horst-Wessel-Lied.
Hello, “Klaps.”
Hello, “Stups.”
[In French] Are you coming with me?
[Hebrew]
Hannah! My Hannah!
Oh!
[In Hebrew] Jerusalem…
your love.
Yes.
[In German] And how’s my Heinrich?
Is he good to you? Yes.
Sometimes too good.
I miss arguing with him.
I can no longer see my way through the maze of modern life.
He argued with me about this trip.
He’s afraid it will send me back to the “dark times.”
This trial is very important for us.
And you’re strong, my Hannah. You always were.
And brave.
Very brave.
Tell me how you are.
How’s your heart?
Not too good.
It’s never gotten used to the world we live in.
Israel has aged faster than you, my little Hannah.
I always thought you’d have many children.
Oh, Jenny. At first we were too poor, and when we had the money, we were too old.
Many people here are poor but they still have children.
Children are important for such a young country.
It was about time you visited us.
She’s not visiting.
[Hannah] You see?
He’s throwing me out already!
I’m only sorry that your visit is thanks to this wild predator.
That’s why he’s being displayed in a cage.
A cage? Made of glass.
[Woman] To protect him from us.
[Crowd Murmuring]
[Man] The high court!
[Man, In Hebrew] When I stand before you here, judges of Israel, to bring charges against Adolf Eichmann, I am not standing alone.
With me are six million accusers.
But they cannot rise or point towards him in the dock.
They cannot cry, “I accuse him!”
For their ashes have been scattered over the hills of Auschwitz and in the fields of Treblinka, and thrown into the rivers of Poland.
Their graves are to be found throughout Europe.
Their blood cries to heaven, but we cannot hear their voices.
And Hausner parades around as if he’s competing with Eichmann for the leading role in a play.
His opening speech was bound to be dramatic.
In the spirit of Ben-Gurion?
He’s behind all this, isn’t he?
Israel has to be very careful that this doesn’t become a show trial.
That’s my Hannah! Just wait a bit.
And try to understand Ben-Gurion.
Our young people refuse to confront what you call the “dark times.”
Either they’re ashamed of their parents who didn’t fight or protect themselves, or they accuse them of having behaved dishonorably.
They think only criminals or whores could have survived the camps.
And you believe Hausner can make them understand what their parents have suffered?
Be a little patient with us.
[In German] Yes, I read here that during the transport 15 people died.
I can only say that these records were not the responsibility of department 4B-4.
They are from the local authorities, according to their guidelines.
[Female Translator, In English] It says here that the order was given by the Reichsführer.
But tell me, why do you have the officer-to be the officer transferring this order?
Why Eichmann?
[Speaking Hebrew]
[Female Translator] Does the Reichsführer have no other way of contacting but Eichmann?
[In German] The document makes it clear that the local police, or headquarters thereof, made the request to Section 4B-4.
Thus I received the matter for its continued processing and dealt with it in an intermediate capacity.
As I was ordered to do. I had to follow orders.
[Man Speaking Hebrew]
[Male Translator, In German] But it was you who decided how many people were to be put into each railway car, no?
[Eichmann] I had orders.
Whether people were killed or not, orders had to be executed.
In line with administrative procedure.
I was only responsible for a small part of this.
The other parts that were necessary until one of these trains rolled out were carried out by another department.
Mr. Chairman, I have the feeling I’m being grilled here until the steak is done.
Because of charges… that are impossible to substantiate.
Now you’ve finally heard the predator.
Are you all right?
Yes, I’m fine.
Good. [Chattering]
Good.
Well…
He’s so different than I imagined.
He was with the SS. They’re scary creatures.
But he’s not.
That’s precisely it.
He sits in his glass box like a ghost…
A ghost who happens to have a cold.
He’s not spooky at all.
He’s a nobody.
He speaks in this awful bureaucratic language.
He suddenly says things like:
“I feel like a rump steak that’s being grilled…”
Incredible!
Waiter! I assume you don’t want a steak now.
Trying to cheer me up?
“One notices the intention and is displeased.”
“One feels the intention and is displeased.”
“What pleases you is permitted…”
Also from Tasso. “What behooves you is permitted…”
“If you would like to learn what behooves one, you have only to ask a noble lady…”
My father was a tailor in Berlin.
He always quoted Faust as he shaved.
Mephistopheles was his favorite.
“Blood is a very special juice.”
Eichmann.
Eichmann is no Mephistopheles.
[Man, In English] My father was 58. My mother-she was 43.
My brother, who was 22. I was 21.
My sister was 19.
My brother was 16.
My other brother was 14.
Sister was eight. And the little brother was five.
We trying to keep together and go along on the road, what have been told by this brave SS.
[In Hebrew] And who remains of your family members?
[In English] Only myself.
[Male Translator Speaking Hebrew]
[In German] When we were counted later on, 200 or 210 of us remained of the 1200 who’d been transported.
The next ones were all gassed.
Those who arrived just after us, they were all gassed.
It was…
Excuse me…

Be calm, please.
Please remain where you are.
Everyone remain where they are.
[Chattering] [Hebrew Continues On Radio]
[Chattering]
Madam, your phone call to America has gone through.
Oh, thank you.
[Hannah, In German] If you could see how they try to stay calm while testifying…
Most of the stories have nothing to do with Eichmann as an individual.
But we both knew from the start that the trial would be more about history than the deeds of one man.
But it’s still dreadful.
Oh, my little girl from far away.
[Female Operator] Three minutes are over.
[Hannah Groans] Three minutes already.
This is costing a fortune! I’ve got to go.
Yes. See you soon.
[Line Clicks]
[Man] Oh, they wanted a central organization, which would be the spokesman of Hungarian Jewry.
[Man #2] Well, it doesn’t matter at what meeting this was, but did they say how many members such a committee should have, which would be responsible to the Germans?
[Speaking Hebrew] [Male Translator] They told us… that about four or five persons should constitute that representative body.
They didn’t call it Judenrat.
And, uh, this also calmed us down, because we knew already… what was the purpose of the Judenrat.
[Female Translator] To what extent… did you report about the situation to the communities and the provinces, those who were deported?
[Male Translator] There was no such possibility, because by the time I obtained this information, and by the time we realized what Auschwitz was, uh, the eastern part of Hungary… and the northeastern part- this comprised these 300, 000 people- they had received news from us.
They had known the fate, but what could we have done?
What could we have done? [Man Shouting Angrily]
[Shouting Continues]
[Man, In Hebrew] Remove him from the courtroom. Quickly!
You are a cowardly dog. A dog!
Remain seated if you want to stay here.
[Chattering]
[Eichmann, In German] An officer swears an oath of allegiance.
If he breaks this oath,
then he is a rogue.
I still hold this view.
I have taken an oath here to tell the truth.
That was how I viewed things then, too: An oath is an oath.
[Man] Do you believe that anyone who swore allegiance would, after Hitler’s death, be released from his oath of allegiance?
After Hitler’s death?
Of course. Everyone would automatically be released.
[Man] When interrogated by the police you said that if the Führer had told you your father was a traitor, you would have shot him yourself.
If he had been a traitor, yes…
No, if the Führer had told you so.
[Man Speaking Hebrew]
Would you have shot your own father? Assuming he had proven this.
Had he proven it, I’d have been obliged by my oath.
Was it proven to you that the Jews had to be exterminated?
I didn’t exterminate them.
[Man] Did you never feel any conflict between your duty and your conscience?
One could call it a state of being split.
Split? Yes…
A conscious split state where one could flee from one side to the other.
One’s conscience was to be abandoned?
Sorry?
One’s personal conscience was to be abandoned?
[Eichmann] You could say that.
If there had been more civil courage, things could have been different.
Am I right? Answer… If civil courage… had been hierarchically organized, then yes, absolutely.
[Man] So this was not destiny.
It was not inevitable.
It was a question of human behavior.
A question of human behavior.
And of course it was… It was wartime, upheaval…
Everyone thought, “It’s useless to resist…”
Yes. A drop on a hot stone that evaporates without purpose or success or… or failure or anything.
It was connected to the times, I think.
To the times, how children were raised, with ideological education, rigid discipline, that sort of thing.
Eichmann not an anti-Semite? That’s nonsense!
You heard him. He was obeying the law.
He’d have obeyed any law.
Oh, please! Anyone in the Party,
let alone the SS, was a committed and vicious anti-Semite.
He swears he never personally harmed a Jew.
So he claims!
Isn’t it interesting that a man who did everything a murderous system asked of him, who even seems eager to give precise details of his fine work, that this man insists he personally has nothing against Jews?
He’s lying! False. He is not.
You’re falling for this?
He claims he didn’t know where the trains were going.
You believe that too?
Knowing that was irrelevant for him.
He transported people to their deaths, but didn’t feel responsible for it.
Once the trains were in motion his work was done.
So he can say he’s free of guilt despite what happened to the people he transported?
Yes. That’s how he sees it. He’s a bureaucrat.
Your quest for truth is admirable, but this time you’ve gone too far!
But Kurt, you can’t deny the huge difference between the unspeakable horror of the deeds and the mediocrity of the man.
Don’t worry, Rahel.
Hannah and I always argued like this.
I’m just afraid she’ll make a lot of people angry.
That’s her nature.
But after finishing our bloody duels… We always found a way to make up.
Hey. Kurt, no!
Think of your heart.
I know. I’m not getting any younger.
That’s why I wish you wouldn’t leave me so quickly.
I’m never very far from you.
Never.
What’s in there?
Transcripts of the trial.
Six tapes of Eichmann’s questioning.
I could have them shipped to New York.
I have to start reading at once.
Bring Heinrich along next time.

Uh, she’s not in right now. She should be back soon.
Yes, certainly. I will give her the message.
[In German] Well?
That polite Mr. Shawn didn’t say as much, but I guess he’s curious to know when you’ll deliver the articles.
There’s not even a verdict yet.
Yes…
How dare that Mr. Shawn call you at all? [Laughs]

But Monsieur here would have finished the articles long ago.
Without a doubt.
Thank you. Frau Professor.

You just have to move my pipe-stand.

Never disturb a great philosopher when they’re thinking.
But they can’t think without kisses.
You can put it here.
Thank you, Freddy. You’re welcome.
[In German] From Israel.
At least 500 new pages from the court.

I’m so lucky to have you, Lotte.
I’d never be such good friends with my own daughter.
My father always says God gave us family, but thank God we can choose our friends.
Well…
[In English] Interesting theory.
[In German] You think I’d have chosen Charlotte?
Oh, I forgot. She called earlier.
She wanted Heinrich’s new number at Bard.
Did you give it to her?
Unfortunately, I couldn’t find it. [Groans]
Careful, Lotte. She’s a psychoanalyst and can probably read your mind…
Should I take these away again? Please.
Thanks.

[Man #2] Once a week the infamous Dr. Mengele selection was held.

PHILOSOPHY FACULTY PROF. DR. M. HEIDEGGER
Miss Arendt.
[Clock Ticking]
You say you want me to teach you how to think.
Thinking is a lonely business.
[Mary] Every time I even write a sex scene, I have you horribly on my conscience, as if you’re tugging at my elbow saying, “Stop.”
I have no problem with sex. I’m afraid you’ll think I’m an exhibitionist or something.
Well, you are. [Chuckles]
But you’ve written your first book without a hint of memoir.
It’s pure fiction, is it?
Is that a left-handed compliment or just straight criticism? No!
I think you’ve written beautifully balanced sentences, and I think at times it’s hilariously funny.
You have never been this positive. Did you hate all my other books? Mary!
Well! You can’t take a compliment.
No. Hannah!
[In German] You are my heroine!
[In English] I thank you. The German Department thanks you.
We all thank you.
Oh, God. Ask him for a raise. [Chuckles]
[Hannah, In German] You see, Western tradition mistakenly assumes that the greatest evils of mankind arise from selfishness. But in our century, evil has proven to be more radical than was previously thought. And we now know that the truest evil, the radical evil, has nothing to do with selfishness or any such understandable, sinful motives. Instead, it is based on the following phenomenon: making human beings superfluous as human beings.
The entire concentration camp system was designed to convince the prisoners they were unnecessary before they were murdered. In the concentration camps men were taught that punishment was not connected to a crime, that exploitation wouldn’t profit anyone, and that work produced no results. The camp is a place where every activity and human impulse is senseless. Where, in other words, senselessness is daily produced anew.
So, to summarize:
If it is true that in the final stage of totalitarianism, an absolute evil emerges, absolute as it no longer relates to human motives, then it is equally true that without it, without totalitarianism, we would never have known the truly radical nature of evil.
What time is it?
Ah.
The second hour has begun. You know what that means.
Thank you.
Thank you.
May I ask you a personal question?
You can try.
Were you in a camp?
I had the opportunity to spend some time in a French detention camp called Gurs.
[In English] But weren’t the French on your side?
[In German] In the beginning. They took us in. But when the Germans invaded France on May 10, 1940, our French friends put us into detention camps. We became a new kind of human being, put into concentration camps by our enemies and into detention camps by our friends.
How did you escape?
[In English] My husband and I were lucky to receive a visa to America.
[In German] A visa. Not a passport. We were stateless for 18 years.
And what was your first impression of America?
[In English] Paradise.
[Gasps, Groans]
[Breathing Heavily]

It’s advanced German class.
They will be delighted to speak English again. Go. Go. Go.
[Sobs]
Dearest.
Don’t cry.
I spoke to the doctor.
He said you only have a fifty percent chance.
Don’t forget the other fifty percent.
[Knocks]

What were you speaking to your students about?
About us.
[In English] I understand.
Thank you for the message.
Yes.
Hannah? Yes.
[Sink Water Running]
They’re hanging Eichmann.
And so they should. They should?
But that’s not justice.
The punishment’s not enough?
The punishment can only give an appearance of justice.
There are no real punishments for his deeds.
That’s why it’d be braver to let him live.
Now the verdict’s in,
you can stop avoiding your New Yorker friends.
Not until you’ve recovered.
You haven’t written a line since my slight collapse.
Wrong. I’ve made some notes.
A brain aneurysm isn’t a “slight collapse” either.
You could have died.
But Eichmann is a monster.
And when I say monster, I don’t mean Satan.
You don’t need to be smart or powerful to behave like a monster.
You’re being too simplistic.
What’s new about the Eichmann phenomenon is that there are so many just like him.
He’s a terrifyingly normal human being.
Not all normal people were head of department 4B-4 at the Reich Security Office charged with the extermination of Europe’s Jews.
You’re right there.
But he considered himself an obedient servant of Germany who had to obey the Führer’s orders.
“My loyalty is my honor.”
The Führer’s orders became the law.
He didn’t feel guilty in the sense of the indictment.
He behaved according to the law.
It’s been proven that Eichmann pursued the Final Solution even after Himmler had long since forbidden it.
And why? He wanted to finish his work.
Don’t you see that every law, every commandment was turned upside down.
It was not “Thou shalt not kill,”
but “Thou must kill.”
To do your duty, goodness was a temptation you had to resist.
[Hans] Great.
So no one is responsible or guilty.
Every sane person knows murder is wrong.
[Laughs] Then most Europeans, including many of our friends, went insane overnight. Heidegger was your friend.
Hans!
He wasn’t our only disappointment.
You can’t write like this for the New Yorker.
You cannot!
Hans, the glass door!
It’s all too abstract. And confusing.
They don’t want a philosophy lesson.
They have to know what the Nazi Eichmann did.
Oh, Hemingway was just an ambulance driver, Thomas.
As a writer, he was nothing more than the premature ejaculator of the 20th century.
Oh, you just hate him because he wrote like a real man.
Do you want to forgive him? That’s absurd.
I’m glad he’ll be hanged.
So, here’s to Heinrich’s recovery.
[In English] Well, come on. Yeah. To Heinrich.
Come over, please. To his health. We drink to his health.
[Mary] A very good idea. [Hannah, In German] Here, Hans. To Heinrich.
[Chattering]
Cheers.
Stups, here’s to you.
No more kissing. Except for me.
Why was Hans so furious with me?
He’s in love with you. Has been ever since he was a student. [Scoffs]
Nonsense.
He hates Heidegger more for stealing your heart than for joining the Party.
[Chuckles]
Then he should hate you even more.
[Chuckles]
Maybe he does.
Celebrating my health
is exhausting.
I’m off to bed.
[Exhales Deeply]
[Door Closes] [Sighs]
[Heidegger] Thinking does not bring knowledge, as do the sciences.
Thinking does not produce usable, practical wisdom.
Thinking… does not solve the riddles of the universe.
Thinking does not endow us with the power to act.
We live because we are alive.
And we think… because we are thinking beings.
[Hannah] We are so used to considering reason and passion as opposites, that the idea of passionate thinking, where thinking and being alive are one and the same, is terrifying for me.
[Clock Ticking]
Excuse me. No. Hannah!

Is this a good time to talk? I mean, are you busy?

Can I be of any help? How?
Perhaps if you’ve finished the first article, I could have a look.
Mr. Shawn, I don’t deliver in pieces.
O-Of course. I do realize what an enormous task this is… and wanted to let you know how much we’re looking forward to the results.
Well, then perhaps I should get back to it instead of chatting on the phone.
Or did you want to pressure me with a deadline?
No, of course not. Take as long as you need.
Thank you.
Bye.
What’s the matter with you? Have you fallen in love with her, or what?
Oh, God, no.
[Man, In German] You claim you weren’t a normal recipient of orders.
You thought about what you were doing.
Didn’t you say that?
[Eichmann] I don’t believe so, no. You didn’t think about it?
[Eichmann] Sorry? You didn’t think about it?
You were an imbecile?
You didn’t think at all? Think?
Yes.
Of course I thought about what I was doing.
You were not an imbecile?
[Chattering In German]
Are you sure you can go?
You’ve got everyone so worried, they’ll have a wheelchair waiting.
[Chuckles] I’m sure some lovely women will be very eager
to push you around.
No one can push me around like you.
Lotte…
Take good care of her.
Thanks.
Listen to this.
I’ve changed the paragraph.
“Evil is supposed to be something demonic. Its incarnation is Satan. But in the case of Eichmann, one could find no such trace of satanic ‘greatness.’ He was simply unable to think.”
That’s great. It’s better, right?
Yes…
Voilà, monsieur.
“From a humdrum life without significance and consequence, the wind had blown Adolf Eichmann into history.”
Fascinating choice. It begins so poetically.
A bit over the top.
“A leaf in the whirlwind of time, he was blown into the marching columns of the 1,000-year Reich.”
Twice in a row with a wind metaphor?
But listen to this.
“It was sheer thoughtlessness. Something by no means identical with stupidity… that predisposed him to become… one of the greatest criminals of the 20th century. He was simply unable to think.”
That’s original.
This here is also quite original.
They’ll have our heads for this: “Wherever Jews lived, there were recognized Jewish leaders, and this leadership, almost without exception, cooperated in one way or another, for one reason or another, with the Nazis. The whole truth is… that if the Jewish people had really been unorganized and leaderless, there would have been chaos and plenty of misery, but the total number of victims would hardly have been… between four and a half and six million people.”
Jewish leaders testified at the trial. It had to be mentioned.
She’s blaming the victims. That’s not true, Fran.
She clearly makes a distinction between the powerlessness of the victims… and the dubious choices of some of their leaders.
“Clearly”? Don’t exaggerate.
The whole section is only 10 pages out of almost 300.
Them’s fighting words, Bill.
You better make sure she’s got her facts straight, or we’ll be needing bodyguards- for her and for us.
She doesn’t strike me as someone who’s off on the facts.
But as for the grammar-
What you have written is simply brilliant.
I suggest that it be broken up into five articles.
Five? If I give it that much space, it will entail very few changes.
I spoke with your editor, and he told me the book will come out directly afterwards.
Congratulations. Thank you.
Shall we? Sure.
This is Greek, right?
“Einai.” It means “to be,” in the sense of existence.
But, of course, you realize that most of our readers don’t understand Greek.
They should learn. [Laughs]
[Exhales Deeply]
There is really only one section…
that, um,
worries us a bit.
Oh, today you say “us,” and not “me”?
Invoking your army, Mr. Shawn?
Yes.
Maybe I am.
It’s this description of the Jewish leaders.
Their relationship with Eichmann’s office was very important.
I think I made that quite clear. Yes, of course, but you do offer a kind of interpretation of your own… that might be-that might disturb just a bit. That is incorrect.
I purposely did not attempt to analyze… or to explain their behavior.
“To a Jew, this role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people… is undoubtedly the darkest chapter of the whole dark story.”
Now that could count as a kind of interpretation.
But it’s a fact.
[Chattering]
Finally. I can’t wait to read it.
How do you like it?
“How”?
“How” is an assumption. You should ask me if I like it.
[Phone Rings]
[Man] You have no right to bring these issues out in public.
You don’t know what you’re talking about. I will cancel-
“Only 10 pages.”
That makes a hundred phone calls per page.
So far. [Rings]
[Woman] …is crap!
[In German] Just ignore them…
[In English] You’ll drive yourself crazy.
[In German] But Shawn’s response in the New Yorker is very convincing.
Should I send it to you?
What response?
To that vicious article in The New York Times.
Oh, you mean that!
[In English] Forget it.
[In German] Tell me how Heinrich is doing.
Charlotte cooks for him every evening.
Please tell her that Heinrich can only eat meat twice a week.
Yes.
Hello… My darling.
You’re all the rage around here. Hello, Stups.
Let’s not waste time on that.
The Israeli prosecutor is flying here to speak to survivors in New York.
Listen to the Daily News headline:
[In English] “Prosecutor Answers…
Hannah Arendt’s Bizarre Defense of Eichmann.”
[In German] On the frontpage! All just a tempest in a tea cup.
This is no tempest. It’s a hurricane, Hannah.
[Hannah] Tell me what’s for dinner.
Spinach, whole wheat bread and water.
It’s good you’re not here in New York.
They are all accusing you of having defended Eichmann, Hannah.
Stups, it’s just a few articles in a magazine.
My dear, you are really naive.
She thinks her sarcasm will protect her.
It only shows me her vulnerability.
She tries to detach herself from the story but ends up bringing it closer to her.
Wrong, completely wrong.
It’s not about her. But where is she… when she writes about this Nazi and his crimes?
She has the right to feel pain, and to show it.
That would be shameless. And quite out of character.
You have to be aware that if she represses so much pain, it will eventually overwhelm her.
And you too.

There are some things… that are stronger than a single human being.
[Man] And did you read the book? You read it? I can’t believe it. I bet she doesn’t even show up.
The worst mistake was to criticize the Jews… while the mass murderer was sitting there in the dock.
Yeah, and to describe this murderer as a clown.
A foolish little servant of Hitler who didn’t have a mind of his own.
And yet she says he’s normal.
That’s Hannah Arendt. All cleverness and no feeling.
[Miller] I love that line in your article, Norman.
I trust you’ve all read Norman’s incisive rebuttal.
What’s it called? “The Perversity of Brilliance.”
“The Perversity of Brilliance.” You were more fair than she had any right to expect.
Now, of course, she’s shocked.
Oh, nonsense. She lives for such intellectual sensations.
And she’s far too smart not to realize the scandal she would provoke… by attacking the Jewish leaders.
[Miller] Exactly.
Last time we met, you were begging her to teach at your department.
Well, won’t make that mistake again.
You’re all treating Hannah Arendt like a suspect in a police court… instead of a respected political thinker.
Please, Bill, no one has attacked Hannah Eichmann’s character.
Your review of Hannah’s work proves that you’re too hysterical… to write a single coherent sentence.
And that charming little slip of the tongue proves that Lionel has lost his power of speech as well.
You’re so smitten with Arendt’s European pretensions.
She could defend Himmler himself, and you’d go along.
Oh, down, Norman. Down. Your fangs are showing.
Almost no one here has even read the articles.
Some of us tried, but couldn’t bear to go on.
Well, of course you couldn’t. Hannah doesn’t write soap operas.
[Norman] And, of course, it would be too much to expect Ms. Arendt… to report on Eichmann’s actual trial.
She had to come up with something more interesting than that.
Who does she think she is? Aristotle?
Unlike all of you, Hannah was actually forced into exile.
She was held in a brutal detention camp.
Isn’t it admirable that she is the only one… who can discuss this subject without beating her breast?
And why do you think that is? Because she’s smarter than people with feelings?
Well, in your case, Norman, being smarter is easy.
She’s more courageous than you are.
[Man] Ladies and gentlemen, there will be plenty of time for discussion after our speakers have presented.
Settle down so we can begin.
[Vehicle Approaching]
[Gasps]
Ms. Arendt?
Siegfried!
You remember me? [In German] Of course.
You were in Kurt Blumenfeld’s Zionist group in Berlin.
[In English] It’s hard to believe that you were once a Zionist.
The Israeli secret service didn’t send you to discuss my youthful folly.
I’m here to request that you stop the publication of your book about Adolf Eichmann.
The State of Israel bought four plane tickets to tell me that?
You must have money to burn to waste it like that.
[In German] It’s incomprehensible that you, a Jew, could tell such lies about your people.
You describe a book I never wrote.
A book that will never be allowed in Israel.
And won’t appear anywhere else either if you have any decency left.
You ban books, and lecture me about decency!
I’m warning you. Wrong. You’re threatening me.
We wanted to ask Kurt Blumenfeld to reason with you, but his doctor said he’s dying.
And we didn’t want to be that cruel.
I thought you knew.
[In German] Rivka, why didn’t you let me know sooner?
Kurt didn’t want that.
Kurt.
What are you doing to me, my dear!
This time you’ve gone too far.
Let’s not argue today.
The cruelty… and ruthlessness you show.
You won’t think that when you’ve read it.
I tried to.
Since when did you listen to others about me?
You have no love for Israel?
No love for your own people?
I can’t laugh with you anymore.
But Kurt, you know me. I’ve never loved any people.
Why should I love the Jews?
I only love my friends.
That’s the only love I’m capable of.
Kurt…
I love you.
[Lotte] These think your articles are terrific.
These think you’re absolutely wrong and should never have written a word.
Anyone I know?
Yes. A few friends.
And these want you dead.
Some of them are quite colorful.
[Doorbell Rings]
I’ll get it.
[Door Opens]
Oh, Lotte… Come in.
Am I too late? No.
Good.
Oh, Hannah, I didn’t know…
Lore, how nice to see you.
I came to help Lotte.
No, no, first come and sit with me.
Here.
You were here yesterday?
I didn’t want to leave Lotte here alone.
Thanks. It goes without saying.
How’s Hans?
He…
Why didn’t he come?
He doesn’t feel well.
[Lotte] Oh, God!
[Lore] What does it say? Oh, nothing.
Come here, Lotte. Read it to us.
[In English] “Your picture is of a face hard as rock… and cold as ice in the North Pole. Contempt hovers on the lips, and an iron brutality is seen in the eyes. I felt that that page on which your picture is on… contaminated the whole of the review. I put on a glove. I felt it revolting to put my bare hand on that page. Ripped it out from the review, and not wanting to give it the… dignity of burning it, I threw it in the garbage can. I do not carry hatred in my heart, nor do I take delight in vengeance, but this I know: that the souls of our six million martyrs, whom you desecrated, will swarm about you day and night. They will give you no rest. It cannot be otherwise.”
It’s sweet of you… to stay with me this evening.
You had such a bad day.
When I was a child my father was very sick.
He died when I was seven.
After a long fight.
I only knew him as a sick man.
And in the dream where he appears he is healthy.
He’s handsome.
He looks at me and he says: I love you.
What are you doing with the letters? Answering them.
No, you will not.
If you start, this will never end.
I’ve hurt these people badly. I have to take that seriously.
We’ve been here 20 years and I’m not packing my bags ever again.
They won’t kick you out because of a few articles!
Are you so sure about that?
The nice, old man on the 10th floor said to give you this right away. [Elevator Bell Dings]
Thank you, Freddy.
DAMN YOU TO HELL, YOU NAZI WHORE
[Chattering]
[Knocks]
We’ve discussed it at length and arrived at a unanimous decision.
We respectfully advise you to relinquish your teaching obligations.
Under no circumstances will I give up my classes.
You may not have enough students who are willing to study with you.
Perhaps you have not been in communication with your own students, but I’m entirely oversubscribed at the moment.
And because of the extraordinary support of the students, I’ve decided to accept their invitation, and I will speak publicly… about the hysterical reactions to my report.
That’s Hannah Arendt, all arrogance and no feeling.
[Murmuring]
Perhaps just for today you will allow me to smoke immediately.
When the New Yorker sent me… to report on the trial of Adolf Eichmann, I assumed… that a courtroom had only one interest: to fulfill the demands of justice. This was not a simple task, because the court that tried Eichmann was confronted with a crime… it could not find in the law books… and a criminal whose like was unknown in any court prior to the Nuremberg trials. But still, the court… had to define Eichmann as a man on trial for his deeds. There was no system on trial, no history, no ism, not even anti-Semitism, but only a person. The trouble with a Nazi criminal like Eichmann… was that he insisted on renouncing all personal qualities… as if there was nobody left to be either punished or forgiven. He protested time and again, contrary to the prosecution’s assertions, that he had never done anything out of his own initiative, that he had no intentions whatsoever, good or bad, that he had only obeyed orders. This… typical Nazi plea… makes it clear that the greatest evil in the world… is the evil committed by nobodies- evil committed by men without motive, without convictions, without wicked hearts or demonic wills. By human beings who refuse to be persons. And it is this phenomenon… that I have called the banality of evil.
Ms. Arendt. You’re avoiding the most important part of the controversy. You claimed that less Jews would have died… if their leaders hadn’t cooperated.
This issue came up in the trial. I reported on it, and I had to clarify the role of those Jewish leaders… who participated directly in Eichmann’s activities.
You blame the Jewish people for their own destruction.
I never blamed the Jewish people!
Resistance was impossible.
But perhaps… there is something in between resistance… and cooperation.
And only in that sense do I say… that maybe some of the Jewish leaders might have behaved differently.
It is profoundly important… to ask these questions, because the role of the Jewish leaders… gives the most striking insight… into the totality of the moral collapse… that the Nazis caused in respectable European society.
And not only in Germany, but in almost all countries.
Not only among the persecutors. But also among the victims.
Yes?
The persecution was aimed at the Jews. Why do you describe Eichmann’s offenses as crimes against humanity?
Because Jews are human, the very status the Nazis tried to deny them. A crime against them is by definition a crime against humanity. I am, of course, as you know, a Jew. And I’ve been attacked for being a self-hating Jew… who defends Nazis and scorns her own people.
This is not an argument.
That is a character assassination.
I wrote no defense of Eichmann. But I did try to reconcile… the shocking mediocrity of the man… with his staggering deeds. Trying to understand is not the same as forgiveness.
I see it as my responsibility to understand.
It is the responsibility of anyone who dares to put pen to paper on the subject.
Since Socrates and Plato, we usually call thinking… “to be engaged in that silent dialogue between me and myself.”
In refusing to be a person, Eichmann utterly surrendered… that single most defining human quality: that of being able to think.
And consequently, he was no longer capable of making moral judgments.
This inability to think… created the possibility for many ordinary men… to commit evil deeds on a gigantic scale, the like of which one had never seen before.
It is true.
I have considered these questions in a philosophical way.
The manifestation of the wind of thought… is not knowledge, but the ability to tell right from wrong, beautiful from ugly.
And I hope… that thinking gives people the strength… to prevent catastrophes in these rare moments… when the chips are down.
Thank you.
[Applause]
[Murmuring]
Ms. Arendt.
Could we please-
[In German] Hans, if I’d known you were here…
I came… in the insane hope you would listen to reason.
But you will never change.
Hannah, between your arrogance and your ignorance, your hopeless ignorance about Jewish affairs, you turn a court trial into a philosophy lesson.
Hans, not now. I’m exhausted.
You behave like a superior German intellectual who looks down on us Jews.
And you accuse us of being accomplices to the Shoah.
You never accepted that the Germans shamefully betrayed you.
They kicked you out and would have killed you if they could.
Your friend Eichmann was responsible for the transports from Gurs.
If you hadn’t been lucky enough to escape on time… you’d have shared the same fate as the women who stayed.
Stop!
They were all deported. All deported to…
Stop it, Hans.
As of today…
I am finished with Heidegger’s favorite student.
Everyone is trying to prove me wrong.
But no one noticed my one real mistake.
Evil cannot be both banal and radical at once.
Evil is only ever extreme.
It’s never radical.
Only good can be profound and radical.
Would you have written about the trial if you’d known what would happen?
Yes.
I would have written about it.
Maybe I had to find out who my real friends were.
Kurt was your friend. He still would be.
Kurt was my family."

Genre: Crime, Thriller, Horror, Mystery

Director: M. Night Shyamalan

Stars: Josh Hartnett, Ariel Donoghue, Saleka, Alison Pill, Hayley Mills
Plot: In M. Night Shyamalan’s latest outing, everyone in a large city is in a frenzy. Why? That’s because they’re up and ready to watch a concert performed by famous pop star Lady Raven. Two of her fans, a man named Cooper and his daughter Riley, attend the concert with high spirits, but things slowly begin to change their tune. Amongst the screams of adoration and sounds of applause, the concert itself has a hidden identity: a front to fish out an infamous serial killer known as The Butcher. With security cameras rigged, armies of policemen with weapons at the ready, and police vehicles surrounding the venue, will anyone survive their concert experience or is there more to The Butcher than meets the eye?
* * *
Go, go, go, Dad.
We’re not gonna break any laws, Riley.
We’ll get there when you wanted to get there.
I promise.
Trust me.
Maybe I’ll be a singer.
Yeah, maybe.
Hurry. Come on, come on.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta tie my shoe.
No dad jokes. This is serious. Come on.
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry!
Nope. Nope. Nope.
Yes. Yes.
Nope, nope, nope…
That’s unfair. I’m twelve.
Champion!
Oh, whatever.
We’re late. This is frustrating, Dad.
We should have come earlier.
Yeah, this was the earliest I could get off work, Riley.
Sorry.




Come here, come here.
Shoulders?
Yeah.
Is she coming or what?
Come out! Come out!
Whoo!
Put me down.
Yes, queen!
Slay!
Lady Raven!
Oh, my God!
She waved at me.
I think I got a good photo.
That was kind of exciting.
I’m so happy she added
this afternoon concert after she sold out.
Tickets, I got tenth row tickets.
No thank you.
Tenth row?
They wouldn’t be real, honey. Don’t let people fool you.
Our seats are good enough.
We’re row 44.
On the floor! Bam!
So, give me the update.
What’s going on with those girls at school?




It’s fine.
It’s fine?
I don’t really wanna talk about it.
Okay. Come here.
You.
Dad, look.
Riley.
Yeah, baby. Go!
They aren’t mean anymore. They just don’t include me.
They keep posting stuff together.
I see.
It must be hard seeing what everyone’s doing all the time.
You guys are so connected even when you’re not that close.
Why don’t you and I take a picture together when we go inside?
You and your dad.
Jody will be so jelly.
That would be like the worst idea.
And don’t say jelly, Dad.
These seats slap, Dad.
Thank you. Thank you.
This is literally the best day of my life!
You did this. Four A’s and a B. I told you I’d get it for you.
I never got grades like that.
A deal’s a deal.
I did get lucky with these seats though, didn’t I?




I know, I know.
Meant to be.
We are Papa’s Boots.
So, what does “crispy” mean?
It means something is good.
Use it in a sentence.
Dude, your house is crispy.
I see.
So if I were to come to somebody’s house and say,
“Yo, your house is extra fried.”
Don’t ever say that.
Why? Extra fried is better than crispy.
Stop. I’m not teaching you any more words.
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!
How y’all doing, my queens and kings?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Yes!
Hey, I gotta go to the bathroom.
You can either stay in the seat
or you can come with me and wait outside the men’s room.
I’m good, Dad. I don’t wanna leave.
You stay in the seat.
Promise?
I promise.




Riley, I mean it.
I’m good, Dad. I don’t want to leave.
Oh, hey! Cooper!
Hi. You’re here with Riley?
Yep.
I’m here with Jody.
I haven’t, uh…
haven’t seen you since that whole parent-teacher…
…thing.
It’s good to see you.
Yeah. Listen, I just really do hope
that they can be friends still, you know?
You know how girls are at this age.
And I talked to Jody and she’s gonna work real hard
to include Riley in things, so…
Riley was really hurt by all this.
As a dad, it’s hard to see that.
Right.
I gotta get back to the seat.
Okay. Well, just tell her that Jody and Sarah and Sarah C.
are sitting right there in section 107, and they’d love to see her.
I’ll see you soon.
Yeah, good to see you.
Hi.
Jody and her mom are here.
Where?
Not near us.
Forget about them.
My father left when I was seven.
I held that anger for a long time.
It was who I was.
And then one day, I decided I had to forgive him,
or I would never move on.
I pretended like he was in front of me, and I said,
“You are not responsible for hurting me.
I release you.”
Everything got better after that.
I want you to picture someone who hurt you.
I want you to try to forgive them.
Say to yourself, “I release you.”
And if you feel you have,
I want you to turn on the light on your phones.
We have to hurry while they set up the stage for the next song.
Hi.
Hi.
Um, can I get that in a small, please?
Uh, I want that too.
Umm…
Look, I only have one left, ladies.
I was standing here before her. Like, forever.




It’s okay, Riley, let her have it. She really wants it.
We can find another one later.
Yeah?
Sure, Dad.
Okay.
You guys are good family. Good values and stuff.
Trust me, you don’t see that.
Listen. I’ll get more soon. I’ll put one for you aside.
Just come see me in like… ten minutes. All right?
Okay.
All right.
Psst!
Cooper.
Jamie.
Hey, what’s with all the police trucks outside
and the cameras everywhere, Jamie?
Something happening?
I’m not supposed to tell. Don’t rat me out.
I won’t.
You know the Butcher? Hmm?
That frickin’ nutjob that goes around just chopping people up?
Yeah.
Well, the feds or whatever heard that he’s gonna be here today.
So they set up a trap for him.
This whole concert, it’s a trap.
Wow. Here?
Yeah. Yeah, they’re watching all the exits.
They’re checking everyone that leaves.
There’s no way to get out of here, except backstage, I guess.
But no one can get backstage.
Yeah. See?
It’s kinda dope, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don’t tell anyone. I’ll get… I’ll get in deep crap.
No.
Okay… Uh, I gotta get back.
But come see me for that T-shirt.
For sure, Jamie.
I just heard about this funnel cake stand.
I think it’s down here.
I’m kinda craving it.
Hold on.
Let me think about where it is for a second.
Come on, Dad. It’s not good for you anyway.
Actually, you know what? I think it was further back where we were.
Do you mind?
She started the next song. Let’s get back to our seats.
Ugh…
I thought this was it.




Dad, come on.
We got a patron injury.
What happened?
I think that woman drank too much, lost her balance.
Let’s clear out and give her some space.
Hey. Why don’t we go outside for a second?
Then we can go back in.
Why? What’s going on, Dad?
Wait, isn’t this one of the songs you always play?
Mm-hm.
Well, let’s stop messing around out here and get back to our seats.
Okay.
Come on.
Whoo!
How you all doing? You having fun?
Whoo! Yeah!
This next song I wrote with a friend of mine, Parker Wayne.
Wish I could just scream his name, and he’d join me for this song.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Hey, maybe if we all scream his name,
he might hear us.
On three, everybody scream “Parker!”
One, two, three.
Parker!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Look at the stage where that guy came out.
I wonder what’s down there.
Hey, we should climb down and see where it leads.
It looks really cool.
What?
Wouldn’t it be unbelievable to see what’s down there?
See how they put on the show?
There might be costumes and things.
That’s crazy, we can’t go down there.
You’re acting strange.
Is something wrong, Dad?
No.
I’m just excited for you, is all.
You’re right, it’s crazy.
Forget your stupid dad.
This concert…
…is crispy.
I’m gonna go see if they have that T-shirt for you back at the stand.
Oh, okay. Thanks, Dad.
Oh, hey! Dad of the year!
Hold one sec. Um…
Right. I gotta get you a, uh, small concert tour tee.
I was about to go down to the storage closet to get more merch.
I can walk with you.
Sure, sure, sure. Um, I’ll be right back, Dawn.
You got this, girl. Just hold it down. All right?
What do you do, Cooper?
Fire department.
No shit!
Of course it’s all the way up there.
Here. Let me help you with that.
Bro! You’re strong.
They ever find that guy?
The Butcher?
No, no. I haven’t heard anything lately.
You know, I’m kind of obsessed with him.
I’ve been following him for all 12 victims.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You’re not squeamish, are you?
Not too bad.
Remember when they found that woman on the bridge?
Well, one of my boys was jogging on the bridge
before they covered it up.
That’s pieces, dawg.
She’s deli-prepped.
Like, this dude is next-level insane.
Sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.
We cool?
Yeah.
Would be dope if they caught him today.
We had a training thing. All the employees of the arena.
They gave us a code to say in each section of the arena
in case we got stopped by the police. Real undercover stuff.
That’s kinda cool.
What’s your code? I mean…
If you can say. I don’t want you to get into trouble.
I mean, you’re fire department, Cooper. You’re on our side.
Yeah.
“Hamilton.”
Can you hold this?
Oh, yeah. Ooh. There you go.
Here, take the top one.
What do I owe you?
Ah, don’t worry about it.
Pass it forward, as they say.
Don’t forget this.
Don’t want you to get cut.
Thanks, bro.
White, north side.
Red, east side.
Black, south side and green for the west side.
Our situation:
Let’s keep it clear who we’re dealing with.
He is a danger to everyone.
This is a photo of one of his victims,
a young man who went to the state university.
He studied to become a teacher.
Married.
Had a two-year-old son. Took care of his parents.
He was awarded the “Most Liked Teacher” at his school where he works.
These are the people who should win.
Remember what the profiler said.
If we get into a confrontation with our unsub,
our job is to get him alone,
away from civilians as quickly as possible.
I will personally take the team member who brings this freak down out to dinner.
Let’s go. Get to work.
There was no trouble?
No, no.
Let’s run down our SMEAC.
Situation, blind spot on northeast corner of the stadium…
Sorry, guys.
Just gotta… check the coffee, okay?
Just… just gonna squeeze through here.
Jeez. You guys are big.
So many of you.
Sorry. [chuckles] Excuse me.
…lower two thirds of the concourse.
We think our unsub was spotted on the top concourse.
There is a stairwell in the southwest corner. We can use that.
Now, this is my concern.
The safety of the general public, the staff…
Hey. Hey.
…to the side, so there is a service elevator…
Where do you guys keep the sugar?
Barrett was supposed to refill that. One second.
Here, you can use my stash.
Thanks.
You guys want donuts?
No.
I’ll leave them out.
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry, guys. Sorry. Sorry, guys.
Cooper! Cooper.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey…
I’m really glad I saw you again. I can tell that you’re upset.
I am upset. My daughter was hurt.
We can talk about it later.
No, no, no.
These girls just need to be able to work things out for themselves.
You know what I’m saying?
To an extent, I do.
But it’s delicate. Let’s discuss it later.
No. Hey!
Don’t mess with me, Cooper.
I’m not someone to be provoked.
I have a dark side. You don’t want to see it.
Look… This is their day.
Riley’s been looking forward to this for six months.
Let’s just have fun, okay?
Okay.
Don’t patronize me, Cooper.
Get him!
Don’t move! Hands behind your head!
Get him out of here, quickly.
What was that? A scalper?
How about this?
Why don’t we get the girls to get a slice of pizza together?
One p.m., Saturday at Carmine’s?
Wait, what?
Just so they have a positive experience.
We don’t need them to be best friends.
They just need to coexist. Not see each other as threats.
Sound like a plan?
I’ll ask Jody.
Thank you. I’m gonna get back to Riley.
Enjoy the rest of the concert.
You too.
…taken into custody.
He was not our unsub.
Repeating, this is Dr. Josephine Grant.
The man apprehended in Concourse B on west side of stadium
is not our unsub.
He’s wanted for a history of B and E’s.
He thought all this was for him and he panicked.
Our person won’t panic.
He’s here and he’s trying to figure out a way out.
I’m gonna give you back to the unit commander.
Okay, I’m being told
we have a potential match in section 417, seat 12.
Reminding everyone, visual markers.
Surveillance footage from area where victims’ bodies were found,
recorded men of various builds.
A redheaded male, two African-American males above average height.
A male with white hair in his 60s.
A white male in his 30s with a tattoo of a rabbit or animal on his right arm.
A white male with a scar on his lower jaw.
Uh, there’s a male near the ramp on the south side of stadium
wearing a yellow sweatshirt. Engage with caution.
Oh, shoot. I forgot my credit card at the T-shirt stand.
I’ll be right back.
Dad, you keep leaving.
I know. After this, I won’t leave you.
You want me to come? I feel bad.
No, you enjoy.
Tell me everything I miss.
Just in case we get separated,
meet me at the orange drink stand right outside the tunnel.
Just in case.
FBI tents are set up on the perimeter.
Barricades are set up along Market Street and Ninth Street.
Ground personnel are stationed at every exit.
Open communication is essential.
Continue check-ins at five minute intervals.
Dr. Grant here.
All sections be ready for contingency four.
I’ve told you how this is going to work.
He’s realized he can’t get out.
He’s going to try to cause a panic.
He’s going to use the chaos of 20,000 people to get by us.
He’s going to make a bomb call to police or set off a fire alarm.
When that happens,
only women and children are let through.
Move! Move!
The hell are you doing out here?
Oh, sorry. I just needed some air.
There was an accident in the kitchen.
Uh…
I freaked out. A friend got burned.
Some sort of kitchen accident. Great.
It was very upsetting. I think she’s gonna be scarred.
What’s the code?
Hamilton.
Well, I’ll get back.
Let’s see your card.
The one you were given at the presentation.
Oh, yeah.
Don’t tell my boss I took a break, okay?
By the way, who was the older woman who gave the presentation?
She looked like she was running the show.
She’s a profiler.
She’s taken down ten of these guys.
She’s thought of everything.
Well, that’s a relief.
Dad.
Dad, what are you doing?
Got it.
You’re acting weird. Is something wrong?
Do you wanna go home?
No.
Listen, I’ll be honest with you.
I just ran into Jody’s mom again, and she started…
You know how she is.
I made friends with the girls next to us. Everything’s already better.
You’re amazing.
Let’s just be together. I want you to see the rest of the concert.
Deal.
Hello, guys!
How do y’all like my outfit? Do you like it?
Hope I get picked for the “Dreamer Girl” song.
Dad?
Dad?
I’m sorry, Riley. What was that?
I said I hope I get picked for the “Dreamer Girl” song.
They pick a girl out of the audience and she gets to go on stage with Lady Raven.
Well, you never know. We’ll keep our fingers crossed.
Yeah, she even gets to go backstage and everything.
Backstage, huh?
Well, that is something.
Hey.
Hey.
I assume you work for her.
Every teenager in here is devoted to her.
She could start a cult.
And they’re hanging on her every word.
Must be something to be that loved, right?
I’m actually her uncle, her mother’s brother.
And she’s really great.
Wow.
Okay, listen.
We’re so excited to be here. I’m Cooper.
How you doing, man?
That’s my daughter, Riley. Over there.
The one losing her mind
even more than the other girls losing their minds.
She just recovered from having leukemia.
Oh, no, it’s okay now. It’s just…
tough road for that little one.
She doesn’t want anybody to know about it.
She felt cursed.
Like, she was chosen to be cursed.
But she’s getting over that feeling, so…
Hey, I’m sorry to dump that on you, it’s just…
No, no.
Look…
I’m really happy we’re here, and I know we’re nobodies,
but please, thank Lady Raven for us.
Hey, what seats you guys in?
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you. Could I talk to her for a second?
Of course.
Thank you for coming to the concert. What’s your name?
Riley.
Hey, Riley. We were wondering if you would like to be
Lady Raven’s Dreamer Girl at today’s show.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Is that a yes or a no?
Yes! Yes. Dad!
Here, put these on.
They’re with us.
We should talk with him.
It’s all good. He’s with us.
You’re all good.
Yeah!
Hey.
Whoo-whoo-hoo!
Yeah, baby!
Thank you.
Hey, sweetie. Are you excited?
Um, so, I’m sure you know how this works, right?
When Lady Raven tells the crowd she’s doing “Dreamer Girl,”
she’s gonna ask for you to come out.
Okay, you’re gonna walk to that spot on stage right there.
You guys are gonna dance back and forth.
You just have to follow her lead, okay?
It’s not about being good, it’s about goofing around.
Okay?
You good?
You good, Riley?
I’m scared.
Hmm, you know what?
When she takes your hand, you’re not gonna be, I promise.
It’s gonna be so good. Okay, I’ll be back.
Mmm. You’re good.
This is my favorite part of the concert.
Looks like our Dreamer Girl is a Riley?
Where’s Riley?
Riley, you wanna come dance with me?
Don’t tell me to breathe!
You little beast!
Your daughter’s never gonna forget today.
If anyone tries to get backstage, let me know.
Whoo!
What? What?
I’m just gonna check and see if there’s space.
She was about to collapse. Where should I put her?
Right through there.
You’re gonna be okay.
Don’t try and stand up.
I could have been a Dreamer Girl!
Hey, we’re gonna get you some juice.
You haven’t eaten anything all day, I bet.
You’re safe now.
You’re gonna be fine in about 30 minutes, okay?
Hey, there you are.
He’s a gem. Can we keep him?
He’s really good with them.
Oh! You helped this girl?
Anyone would have done the same.
Wow. Thank you.
Okay. Come on up.
Okay, so you guys can watch from the side here.
This is gonna be her last song.
It’s the encore, so you just enjoy, okay?
Okay, thank you.
Okay!
Bye!
Lady Raven! Lady Raven! Lady Raven!
I don’t understand. I don’t understand it.
I said Lactaid milk.
Lactaid milk, not whole milk.
You won’t stop until I doo-doo on myself, now, will you?
Will you?
Everyone needs a break when they’re starting out.
And I got mine from the dopest person ever.
I owe a lot to The Thinker.
Hey, when this is over,
can we go out the back here to get to our car?
Oh, yeah. That’s fine. No worries.
Thanks.
Sure.
I’ll see you tonight, yeah? All right.
How you doin’?
Oh, my God.
Dad, look, look!
Mr. The Thinker, I got that kombucha just like you asked.
No, that’s feral fig.
I specifically said I wanted honeysuckle sour kombucha, bitch.
Of course you did. I can fix that.
Knock on the door.
Yes.
Knock harder. Damn!
Hey!
Hi!
You killed it.
Thank you. Great show.
Thank you. You too, you too. Going back to LA?
Yeah. See you there.
Yeah. DM me. Bye.
All right. Bye.
Hot zaddy!
Oww!
All male stadium employees
should be run through the system again.
We will stop every male in attendance at this concert.
One of you is going to be talking to the Butcher
in the next 20 minutes.
You may count on it.
Hey. All right, she wants to say bye
and thank you to you guys. She’s just got to get done
some radio meet and greets, okay?
All right.
This is some concert gear
for you guys.
Thank you.
You’re welcome.
And thank you again for all of your help.
Of course.
All right, so you guys are gonna go out the back way.
Uh…
Yeah. Okay, so you’re gonna go through a police inspection there.
They’ll ask you some questions. It’s nothing.
We just have some extra security tonight.
It’s a pain in the butt, but we’ve all gotta do it.
Only Lady Raven and her very close group are excluded.
And you were so great tonight, angel.
She’ll be out soon, okay?
Okay.
Okay!
Oh, my gosh, Dad, there’s so much stuff in here.
Look!
Oh, my gosh, Dad, there’s so much in here.
Dad, there’s tattoos.
Dad, there’s three drink bottles.
Oh, there’s two white ones. We’d be matching.
Do you want one? We could be matching, Dad.
Yeah. Great.
Oh, this is so cool.
There’s no sign of him at all?
He’s playing his hand very well.
But this is an inevitability.
There were 20,642 in attendance today.
There were 3,000 men here.
We will have photos and data on all of them.
We’re questioning everyone as they leave.
He is one of those 3,000.
We will catch him.
He’s out of moves.
I’ll give you an update soon.
Riley!
Did you have fun up there?
Yes.
That’s so amazing.
Thank you. My dad got it for me. It’s an antique.
Hey. I think you heard about my daughter’s condition?
Can I talk to you alone for a moment?
Just for like one minute?
Of course.
I’m gonna talk to your dad for a second.
BRB.
We’ll leave soon, honey.
Wait outside. Just give me a second.
I’ll leave right after.
Thank you for everything you’ve done for Riley.
She’s an angel.
I feel so close to her. I don’t know why.
She really is special.
I don’t know if you know anything about carbon monoxide.
Your body wants the poison. It wants it more than oxygen.
That’s why it can be so very lethal in small spaces.
You need to know about these sort of things as a firefighter.
I’m sorry?
Well… the reason I wanted to talk to you…
is…
…I think you’re looking for me.
I mean, all of you.
Hold on.
Oh, wait, I gotta press mute so he doesn’t hear us.
Help!
Yep.
You see that little box?
That is going to release carbon monoxide…
Help me!
…and kill him within five minutes.
He is going to die if I am caught.
That’s just an absolute fact.
I can do it from here, from this device,
like… …calling an Uber.
You caught me. I admit it.
But… you can save him.
I’ll let him go if you do one thing.
What you’re going to do in front of everybody
is you’re going to ask me and my daughter
if we want a ride in your limousine.
And then you’re gonna drive us out of here.
I will press it right now if you signal them.
Save him. Catch me.
Save him. Catch me.
By the way, it was a great show.
His name is Spencer.
He’s 22 years old.
He’s into sustainable agriculture.
Somebody help me, please!
Please help me!
Help!
Whoa.
Right through here. Right this way.
Move along.
Through here.
All right.
These three are cleared.
To your left.
Everybody forward.
Through. Right through here, sir.
Through here. Exit through here.
Get out, let’s go.
Let’s just move along.
Limo’s clear.
You can just drop us off on the near corner.
We’re parked nearby.
Um, can I…?
Yeah.
Hey, Riley.
Mm-hm?
Can I visit your home?
What?
Yeah.
How about right now?
I could drop you there.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, this isn’t happening.
Is this happening?
Oh, my God, that would be, like, so incredible.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Mom. Mom, you won’t believe it. You will not believe it.
Me and Dad are in a limousine, and we’re here with Lady Raven.
No, I’m not making it up. I’m not making it up.
I got picked to be the Dreamer Girl onstage,
and then she asked to drop us off and now she wants to see our house.
Yeah, I know, I know. Dad can’t believe it either.
He’s just sitting there.
Can she come? Mom, come on.
She doesn’t care about the carpet.
Mom, please. Please? Say yes.
Mom said yes. Mom said yes!
Great.
Thank you.
Huh.
Jeremiah. We’re gonna be visiting a friend’s house.
What’s the address, sweetheart?
108 Monk Road.
Mm-hm.
Oh…
Dad’s acting strange.
How?
Oh, I’ll tell you later.
Just wait here.
Um…
This is Lady Raven. She’s… my friend.
Pleasure to meet you.
It’s an honor to meet you.
We feel like we already know you.
My name is Rachel.
Thank you for letting me visit.
I just got to know your daughter. I think she’s wonderful.
She is.
And this is Logan.
Hi, Logan.
I saw you on TV.
You did?
Wow.
Well, let’s not stay out here.
Come in, if you can. Have a bite.
That sounds great.
Come.
Lady R-Raven?
Um… I just made a couple things.
Nothing fancy like you’re used to.
I would have made more if I had more things.
I love everything. I can’t wait.
Can I show you my room?
Of course.
Logan, help me clean!
I’ll kill young Spencer if you say anything in front of them.
If you send a text or if the police show up, I’ll kill him.
I think you know I’m not bluffing.
I’m in control.
I don’t know what you think you’re doing.
I won’t do anything.
Okay.
I made the pie to celebrate Riley.
She got a wonderful report card.
Is it fluffy? It’s a Martha Stewart recipe.
Perfect. Just the right amount.
I love your necklace.
Cooper got it for me on sale. He’s good at finding bargains.
Always comes home with something special.
What’s it like to do a concert?
I’m a theater teacher for the fifth graders.
It must be so much work, I can’t even imagine.
It was actually very strange today.
Not like a normal concert day.
Oh, really? Why is that?
Do you know who the Butcher is, Rachel?
The Butcher?
Um…
You mean, crazy person who does that to people? I…
Yes, I’ve heard of him. Uh…
He’s a monster. That’s all I can say.
My friends and I have had nightmares.
Well, apparently, he made a mistake.
About two weeks ago, the FBI and police came to me
and they told me they had found out
he was gonna be at my concert today.
They found a portion of a receipt for a ticket.
They found it in one of his fake houses,
they’re fairly certain are his.
For some reason, he bought tickets to my concert.
We had no idea why.
Most of my fans are teenage girls.
My God. Well, did you catch him?
Not yet.
Did they tell you anything about him?
They did.
They said he was probably a man in his 30s or early 40s.
White.
Who probably has a position of authority.
So interesting.
They even know he drives a dark-colored car.
They have photos of his car?
No. You know, from the precision
of the crime scenes and fake houses,
he’s what’s called an organized offender.
Probably OCD.
Those individuals always drive dark cars
because they appear cleaner.
Wow. They’re so smart.
They’ve sure learned a lot about him.
Yeah, I had no idea they knew all this.
He was a man who had a scarring relationship with his mother.
She was probably the first person to sense he was different.
What a stressful day you must have had.
You must be tired.
Oh, that’s true.
Don’t feel like you have to stay here to be polite.
You’ve been so incredibly kind to Riley.
Let me walk you to the door.
I could play a quick song.
Oh, my God.
On our piano?
She’s not gonna do it.
You’ve all been so kind to me.
One last song before I go.
Riley, come sit with me.
Riley, come on, baby.
Riley plays this one all the time.

Yeah. Um…
Has anyone seen my phone?
Use your dad’s phone.
Can I have my phone back, please?
I have to go to the bathroom. Where is it?
Oh, right back here.
I need my phone back now.
Cooper?
I need my phone.
Dad.
What are you doing, Cooper?
Give me my phone.
Dad, why are you so upset?
Cooper, I need you to step away from the door.
Hello?
Hello?
Stop it! Cooper, you’re scaring the kids.
Sit down.
Dad, why are you so angry?
You’re acting weird.
Kids, go up to your room. Now!
Can you hear me? Yes.
Where are you? I don’t know.
Are you in a house?
Yes, he had my head covered.
I could only peek out through a hole.
Open the door, please.
Dad.
He asked me to help jump his car.
Right now.
Cooper!
There’s a table, with knives and cleavers and things.
Is your name Spencer? It is.
We don’t have much time.
Tell me anything you remember to help me find you.
Anything distinct.
There was a broken lion.
We stopped at a light, and I saw the shape of a lion.
Something was broken off of it.
Like a statue?
Less than a minute before we pulled into the house.
And the door was blue. The door of the house was blue.
I saw it in the rearview mirror as he backed up.
Where is the master key for the bathroom?
Have you lost your mind?
Dad, stop it.
You shouldn’t have done this.
Done what?
I’m gonna be right back. I’m gonna try to get you help.
Who are you talking to?
Please step away from…
You’re acting weird.
Please, Dad. Please.
You’re scaring Riley.
Hey guys,
I need help here. I need it right now.
There’s a young man named Spencer, in a basement.
He needs us to find him.
This is not a joke.
We only have seconds. I know you can do this.
Does anyone in Philadelphia,
or nearby New Jersey
live near a statue of a broken lion?
It must be an entrance to a building or a park.
Go upstairs.
Dad, please. Stop!
Go upstairs.
Of those people who answered,
does anyone live on a street nearby
where there is a blue door on a house
somewhere in your neighborhood?
Dad, stop it.
The kids are terrified right now.
I’m so sorry.
Goddamn it! Open the door!
Step away from the door, please!
To the girl who just answered, there’s only a few minutes.
Get your family and other adults and go there right now.
There is a young man in a basement.
Go now, go now. Hurry!
Cooper, please.
Please, just take a breath with me.
Open the goddamn door!
Dad, stop it!
Cooper, would you please just step away from the door?
Sit down, Rachel.
Cooper, slow down, okay?
Rachel, listen to me. Your husband is the Butcher.
Cooper is the Butcher.
What’s happening?
Go upstairs!
May I have my phone?
And the rest of the phones you have?
Yours, Riley’s, I assume.
What did you do with your family?
Who were you talking to?
Spencer.
Oh…
What’d you say to him?
How did you do that?
We’re leaving.
We’re leaving.
It is important that my hand
stays on your shoulder at all times.
Go to the far wall, please.
You’re doing great.
I’m sensing very little resistance in your shoulder.
Let’s go to the car.
This is Rachel’s car.
They were right about my car.
It’s aurora black.
I’m sensing something in your shoulder.
I would not consider that.
Put these on, please. I’d really appreciate it.
Cooper… you listen to me now.
Enough of this foolishness.
You’re gonna sit in your seat or you’re gonna be punished.
Come on. I know what you’re doing.
Did I tell you you could talk back to me, Cooper?
That profiler told you things.
You never listen when you’re told.
I know what you’re doing.
There’s a way to be a good boy, Cooper.
There’s a way to turn yourself good.
Well, that’s just not true.
You can choose to be good, Cooper,
and make everyone proud.
The way you did when you were little.
You sometimes did good things.
I used to be punished a lot.
I didn’t know how else to deal with you.
I’ll just do this one last one.
And then I’ll kill myself.
It’s the only way to stop the monster.
Stop telling stories! Monsters aren’t real.
Yes, they are…
[sarcastically] Mom.
Put on the fucking ties.
I have a GPS on my phone. They know where we are.
I know. We’ll throw it out the window in a mile or two.
[garage door rattling]
[speaking softly] I locked them in Riley’s room.
There’s a window and a nearby tree.
Never looked at this place through that lens.
Never let the two lives touch.
What’s going on, Daddy?
What are you doing?
[Riley cries]
[car door opens]
We are leaving in my car.
Riley, everything is gonna work out
with those girls at school.
Rachel, the water heater guy is coming on Tuesday.
Don’t let him trick you into buying a new one,
it works fine.
[Rachel whimpers]
Logan, don’t forget to hand in that science project, buddy.
[distant sirens wailing]
[tires screeching]
Go! Go, go, go, go, go.
[sirens wailing]
[tires screeching]
[sirens continue]
[indistinct radio chatter]
[glass clattering]
[water running]
[indistinct chatter]
[radio chatter]
[radio chatter continues]
[indistinct shouting]
Get the family and non-personnel out of here, please.
[officer] Delta team, move!
[officer over radio] Neighbor spotted him
through back kitchen window. He’s in back.
Make sure the men have a clear line of sight
into back of house and kitchen.
Keep eyes on him.
Move! Move! Move!
[door bangs]
Go! Go!
[man with southern accent] Thank you for standing by, sir.
I’mma drive her on out of here.
[Jeremiah] Yes, sir.
[limo starts]
Extracting civilian asset.
Support. Support.
Eyes open. Watch corners.
What’s happening?
[officer] There’s something in the kitchen closet.
A tunnel. It appears to lead to the neighbor’s yard.
[officer] Tell ’em to move out, right now.
[officer 2] Perimeter SWAT member down.
SWAT member in neighbor’s yard down.
[engine shuts off]
[car door opens]
[footsteps approaching]
[cries out]
[gasping]
Sorry, we got interrupted.
[handcuffs rattling]
[car door slams]
[car door opens]
[groans]
[engine starts]
I have a safe place about ten minutes from here.
Luckily, it has a garage.
A lot of places have fire code violations
and stay vacant for years.
Wasted space, I always thought.
[indistinct chatter]
[Cooper] When I saw you waiting behind the curtain on stage,
I got the urge.
It’s strange when I get the urge.
I think it’s when I see someone who thinks they’re whole.
[car horns honking]
That could never be true.
Everyone’s in pieces.
[window clicks and whirs]
Oh shit! It’s Lady Raven.
[Lady Raven] Help me.
[woman] Why?
Wait, what’s going on?
Call the police.
[people clamoring]
[woman] Is that actually Lady Raven?
[man] No way!
[limousine horn honks]
[handcuffs rattling]
[grunting]
[handcuffs continue rattling]
[pedestrians chattering]
[straining]
[excited chatter]
[handcuffs rattling]
[excited chatter]
[all shouting, screaming]
Can you see her?
[sirens blaring]
[rapid footsteps approaching]
[indistinct chatter]
[officer] He’s in the car.
Move civilians away from the vehicle.
Move, move! Back, back, back.
[chaotic chatter]
[air hissing]
[SWAT officer] We assume you are armed.
We will not come closer.
Get out of the vehicle.
I will not ask again.
[gunfire]
[crowd screaming]
[glass clinking]
[indistinct shouting]
It’s only a SWAT helmet and gear propped up.
He must have been with the crowd
when we pulled them away from the limo.
Check all the stores. Do not let the crowd leave.
[sirens blare]
[speech not audible]
[indistinct radio chatter]
They say you lecture on this.
What would I hear at one of your lectures?
This individual is not a projection of our fears.
He is real, comfortable and thriving.
He doesn’t set off warning signals
in our nervous system,
but he is profoundly different.
A parent might have sensed this at the beginning,
but no one else after could.
Your children are with your sister.
It’s not too late to take up our offer.
We can put you all together somewhere.
No. [clears throat]
I don’t want to be around people.
There are two cruisers outside, all night.
Thank you.
[keyboard clattering]
[igniter clicking]
[sighs]
[Cooper] You always do that.
[Rachel screams, gasps]
You always stand with your left hand on your hip
like it’s holding you up.
[Rachel gasps]
Cooper.
It’s funny how we knew each other so well.
I guess we know things without knowing them.
[stammers]
I’m sure they’ve made a mistake, Cooper.
I’m sure it’s a misunderstanding.
I’m not great at a lot of things Rachel,
but keeping my two lives separate
is not one of them.
It’s a big mix-up. I’ll tell them.
[laughs nervously]
When I had a second to think about it,
it kinda dawned on me how this might have happened.
Maybe the trap wasn’t set there at the concert.
Maybe it was set here.
I…
I’m not following you.
Well, maybe it kind of dawned on you, too.
The late nights, the jewelry.
Maybe you thought I was having an affair.
[breathes shakily]
I did.
But that didn’t feel right.
What was it about it that didn’t feel right, Rachel?
The smell of cleaning fluid on your clothes.
Not the type at the firehouse, the type you smell at hospitals.
[exhales]
Nothing I could have done about that, I’m afraid.
I saw you make up a lie once.
To our neighbor.
About why we couldn’t come to his party.
He sort of surprised us at our car.
You lied so convincingly…
so honestly off the top of your head
right in front of me.
No one would ever know you were lying.
It gave me chills.
I thought…
“Where did he learn to do that?”
Can I take it from here?
Just to see if I got this right.
A small consolation prize.
[metallic scrape and ring]
You follow me one day… to the safe house on Brewster.
The one I go to when I just want to think, plan,
not to do anything.
I find it just as comforting as the doing.
And then, if I’m guessing correctly,
you went back on your own.
And I broke in.
But there’s nothing in there, Rachel.
Just a chair and a table.
And then the thought just came to me.
[breathing shakily] I couldn’t get rid of it,
the feeling just kept coming back to me.
I had a receipt from your wallet
when I went through it from before.
A receipt from the concert, and I left it there.
And then I found a payphone and called the police
to say that it might…
that it might be…
…the Butcher.
I tore it so it would look like a mistake.
Your mistake.
I didn’t know what would happen.
I just thought it would get them closer to you.
And maybe I was wrong. Maybe they would prove that.
When I went back, I saw officers interviewing the neighbors.
I didn’t know how they found it or what happened,
but I never went back there again.
You’re not okay, Cooper.
I know that.
We could have managed.
Let’s finish this, at least.
Riley’s pie.
It was supposed to be a celebration.
Sit back down.
Just for a last moment.
No knives, please.
[dishes clattering]
[Rachel breathing shakily]
This won’t delay it much, I’m afraid. [sighs]
I’ll eat this in five bites.
I know.
I feel such rage toward you, Rachel.
I’ve never felt this before.
That’s different. That’s…
…about being seen by them.
At the end, the way they look at me…
…it strangely gives me peace.
There’s almost no darkness in it at all.
[fork scraping against plate]
This is pure anger.
It’s so unfamiliar.
It’s like it’s eating me from the inside.
I feel out of control.
[fork scrapes against plate]
But it’s why I’m angry that’s amazing.
It’s because I won’t see Riley and Logan again.
Because of you…
I won’t get to see them grow up.
[voice wavering] And that’s overwhelming me.
Because…
it’s gonna end in… [sniffles]
…the average way.
A headline of murder-suicide.
[breathes shakily]
[kettle whistling]
You found my bag.
[whistling continues]
[Rachel] You left it in the car.
The police were too busy trying to track you down.
Is that what you used on them?
Just to calm them.
[whistling continues]
[breathing heavily]
[Cooper’s mom] It’s amazing that you are angry, son.
I thought I was pretending.
But I wasn’t.
[Cooper’s mom] Not all of you is a monster.
Not all.
You’re my son.
And this is who you are.
End of story.
[knife scrapes]
It’s good it’s over.
It’s good you’re…
…you’re stopping the monster.
Let see me you one last time.
I accept you.
Come closer.
[breathing rapidly]

We’ll get your kids back to you soon.

[Cooper] Please, give me a second.
[indistinct radio chatter continues]
[Rachel] Don’t shoot him!

Oh, my God.
[Dr. Grant] Let her go!

After a seven year long manhunt, the identity of the Butcher has finally been revealed.
Cooper Abbott, a local fireman and family man, has been arrested.
Here is a picture of him at a local event.

That’s Cooper!
Oh!

Hey. Come here. I got you.
I’m so sorry.
Hey, you’re gonna be okay.
I’m so sorry you couldn’t be here, honey.
I don’t know what we’re gonna do. What are we gonna do? [SNIFFLES]
Okay.
JENNY: Oh, God. We have to pick flowers.
LILY: We do, yeah.
I can’t believe we’re picking flowers for your father’s funeral.
I know. I know.
I don’t know why you moved. I don’t understand it.
I mean, if I had that job that you had…
Oh, boy, I would’ve killed for that job.
I appreciate your support and enthusiasm, Mom. I really do.
I love you. I’m gonna go set my stuff down.
JENNY: Okay.
LILY: It’s lilies.
What?
The flowers for a funeral. They’re…
Oh, lilies.
I’m so… I’m so glad you’re home.
Me, too.




[SOFT MUSIC CHIMES]
JENNY: He really loved you.
Who?
Your father.
I know. I, um…
Yeah, I know.
How’s the eulogy coming, hon?
Mm. It is, uh, one of the most beautiful things I’ve never written.
Just say five things you loved about your father.
Mama, it’s… it’s not a grocery list.
Just five… five things.
Simple.
From the heart.
You’re gonna be great. It’s gonna be great.
MAN: We’re here to honor the prestigious, generous Andrew Bloom.
Deeply beloved mayor of this fair town.
Husband of the highly adored Jenny Bloom.
And father to the wonderful and sweet Lily.
Lily, come on up to the stage, darling.
Uh, hello. Thank you all for joining us.
In honor of my father’s life, I would, um, like to share with you the… the five things that I love most about him.
He… [CHUCKLES]
I’m sorry.

[CHAIR CLATTERS]
[MAN BREATHING HEAVILY]
[LIGHTER CLICKS]
It’s a strong chair.
Is it?
I’m… I’m sorry.
It’s… It’s been a day.
Will you please get down from there?
I’m… I’m good. Thanks.
It’s making me nervous sitting so close to the edge.
Please?
Cherry on top?
I’m okay.
You gotta be…
I once read that maraschino cherries stay in your stomach for, like, seven years.
Or cause cancer. I forget which.
I didn’t know that about maraschino cherries.
Yeah, I may have made that up, but they’re pretty gross.
Yeah, they’re definitely gross.
So, what happened?
Sorry?
What was that over… I didn’t mean to, but…




Was it a woman?
Or man? I…
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
It was a chair, wasn’t it?
Yes.
So, what floor you live on?
LILY: You first.
Top floor, right next to my sister and her husband.
Oh.
What do you do for a living?
Neurosurgeon.
[LAUGHS]
Is that funny?
Jesus. You’re serious.
Yeah.
Oh, really?
Wow.
Oh, my God. Please. I’m so sorry.
No, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. You’ve spent way too…
[LAUGHING] I’m sorry.
You’ve spent way too much time in school to have me laughing like this.
I’m terrible. I’m sorry.
I… I thought you were a crypto bro.
You thought I was a crypto bro?
No, no, no.




Yeah, no, well, I don’t know, or like a really expensive prostitute.
Well, I am expensive.
[LAUGHS]
You can forget about kissing on the mouth.
Well…
Why haven’t I seen you before?
Well, mostly because I’ve never required brain surgery.
But also ’cause I don’t live here, so…
So, you just broke into my building?
You have a really nice view.
I do.
What’s your name?
Lily.
You?
Ryle.
Ryle what?
Kincaid.
You just made that up just now.
Why would I make up my last name?
Well, I mean… Fine.
What’s your last name?
It’s fine. We don’t need to… We don’t need to do this.
I’m just asking your last name.
It was really nice meeting you.
Thank you. Just be careful.
Okay.
It would be courteous to give me back your last name.
I’m not gonna stalk you.
[LAUGHS] No, it’s just really… It’s sort of embarrassing.
What is it?
Bloom.
Your name is Lily Bloom?
Yes.
It… It actually gets worse.
Yeah. Yeah, no. It… It does.
No way. Not possible.
Than Lily Bloom?
I don’t wanna talk about it, ’cause it’s really kind of embarrassing.
I’m obsessed with flowers. I…
And I’m about to open my first flower shop.
Flower shop?
Yeah, it’s a lifelong dream, so…
[LAUGHING]
Stop. I told you.
RYLE: No, Lily Bloom the florist.
[BOTH LAUGH]
No, doesn’t sound made-up at all.
Hey, you could always use your middle name
if it doesn’t work out.
No, Violet.




Trust me.
Petunia.
No, stop.
Of the valley.
[LAUGHS]
Toadflax.
Blossom.
Goddamn, your parents hate you.
Well, I mean, we may never know for sure, ’cause my dad died on Monday, so, um…
Yeah, that’s actually why I came up here, to have a good cry and, hopefully, meet a wealthy neurosurgeon.
So… [CHUCKLES]
I’m sorry.
I could’ve made it back, um, you know, to see him before he died, but I…
I didn’t.
Damn.
Yeah.
Well, you know, naked truths aren’t always pretty.
I watched a little boy die tonight.
He was only six years old.
His brother found a gun in his parents’ bedroom, and it went off by accident.
Tried everything.
No one should have to…
I can’t imagine what that’s gonna do to that little boy who lived.
[VOICE BREAKING] Destroy him for life. That’s what it’ll do.
All right, give me another one.
Naked truth. I like that.
Go on.
Okay.
I… I don’t know… Uh…
[SIGHS]
The first guy I had sex with was homeless.
Stop it.
Yeah, no, really. In high school, yeah.
Tell me more.
I actually think we’re supposed to say “temporarily un-homed,” or, um, “displaced.”
I shouldn’t have said…
Now you’re avoiding the question.
I’m not. There’s nothing to tell.
I want the good stuff.
Okay, I was friends with this boy named Atlas.
And he was kind and incredibly capable and, you know, he just got a shit hand.
You’re making me jealous of a homeless man.
Oh, my.
Okay, that’s enough. That’s…
Your turn.
Oh, no, I think I’m done. Can’t top that.
That was both sexy and disturbing.
[LAUGHS] Okay, just shock me. Say… I mean, you can say anything.
I wanna have sex with you.
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] What? I mean…




You said to shock you.
What?
How many… I’m sorry.
How many women has this worked on?
I’m not a relationship person.
Yeah, I gathered that.
Never been good at them.
But how do you know
if you’ve never tried having a relationship or carbs?
How do you know it doesn’t work for you?
Carbs? I never said I didn’t eat carbs.
Come on, you don’t look like a reckless snacker.
Well, thank you.
[CHUCKLES]
Love isn’t for me.
Lust is nice though.
I feel like you’re missing out.
Am I?
You haven’t answered my question.
Forgot what the question was.
How many women has this worked on?
All of them.
Oh.
Well, I…
I can’t… I’m…
I’m gonna have to break your record.
I’m the kind of girl you take home to mama.
How far would you go?
I’m not sure. I’m an unreliable narrator.
You could try me.
[SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Too far?
No.
This?
Depends what happens next.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
RYLE: Ah, shit.
Yeah.
No, I’m not supposed to…
Okay, prep the OR. Tell Tom he’s cutting.
I’m gonna supervise.
All right, I’ll be there in ten.
Holy shit.
I know. I’m sorry.
No, I mean, holy shit. I… I… I just now realized you’re actually a neurosurgeon. [LAUGHING]
I tried to warn you.
No, congratulations.
That’s… That’s amazing.
Yeah.
I… This is… You know, I…
[EXHALES SHARPLY] I’ll see you around.
Will you?
No.
It was nice meeting you, Lily Blossom Bloom.
It was nice meeting you, Ryle Siegfried Kincaid.
I like that.

I don’t know what you’re talking about.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
So, why are you at that house?
My mom kicked me out.
Why?
Because…
she likes dating guys who beat the shit out of her.
LILY: What happened to your hand?
GIRL: God, I can smell him from here.
[GIRLS GIGGLING]
It got in the way.
LILY: Look, my parents don’t get home from work till around 5:00,
so if you wanna shower or…
I don’t know, wash clothes or…
I don’t mind.
Yeah.
Sure.
Your enthusiasm’s contagious.
WOMAN: [ON TV] Did you feel the earthquake this weekend?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
WOMAN: You did?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Hey.
Thanks for the clothes.
Yeah, of course.
My dad won’t even know they’re gone.
He doesn’t usually wear jeans much, so…
[TV CHATTER CONTINUES]
Um, my parents aren’t gonna be home for an hour or so, if you wanna watch TV or something.
So, uh, what do you wanna do after you graduate?
I’m, um… signed up to go to basic training in May.
Basic training. What is…
In the Marines.
Oh.
Wow.
[LAUGHS]
I’m sorry. I’m… I’m sorry. It’s just the… the clothes…
My dad’s clothes,
they make you kind of look like Ned Flanders a little.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
Your clothes kind of make you look like a carrot.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
LILY: Mom…
JENNY: [OVER PHONE] If it doesn’t work out…
Mom, you do know a challenge only excites me.
I… I… I said, “If.”
“A flower sales statistic that shocks many new store owners…”
Mom, what makes you think it’s not gonna work out?
“…a whopping 45% of all flowers die…”
Mom.
Mom, are you reading this from Google?
Of course I am. How would I know that?
I’m worried about you. Google is worried about you.
Well, you’re both too late. I’m picking up the keys now.
Okay, okay. Okay.
I love you. You can do this.
Wait. Sir! Sir! Hi.
Make it bold and brave.
Okay, Mom.
You sound crazy. I’ll talk to you later. Bye.
Hi. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.
I, uh… I just moved here.
Okay, sweetheart. Good luck.
Thank you.

Hello.
Hi.
Oh, sorry. Hi. Yeah. I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry.
I can’t… [CLEARS THROAT]
Oh, wait.
I can’t hear you. Hi.
Hi. Can I help you?
Can I help you?
Excuse me?
The “help wanted” sign out front?
You have a “help wanted” sign out front.
Oh, God. I’m so sorry. Yeah, I didn’t… I didn’t put that out there.
I just, yeah, got this place.
I figured. It’s pretty old.
And I walk by this place every day, and I’m just obsessed with it.
I’ve always wanted to see inside, and I was wondering, like, “Who’s gonna come along?”
And it’s you, yeah?
No, it’s me. Yeah, hi.
Are you the owner?
Yeah, I’m… I’m Lily.
Allysa.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry. Ooh, disgusting.
[CHUCKLES]
Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah.
Well, yeah, are you looking for any help?
Well, I’m not hiring just yet.
I just… I just got the keys a few days ago, and I’m still sort of, you know, figuring out what I’m doing, so…
Um, may I just ask, what is this place going to be?
A flower shop.
Ugh.
I’m so sorry. Um…
I have an issue with…
My face says it all. I just hate flowers.
You hate flowers?
I do.
Oh, okay.
Like, why don’t you just give me something that’s living rather than something that’s on its way to dying?
And then it’s gonna create more work for me, and I’m gonna have to deal with that, but again, it’s a solo perspective.
It’s… I find flower shops depressing. It’s just me.
I do wish you luck. I’m so sorry.
I agree. I find them depressing.
Because I feel like… [SIGHS]
I don’t know, it’s like the beauty of what a flower is…
This is ridiculous.
The beauty of what a flower is has been lost, right? It’s… It’s, um…
It’s like we order them like takeout now… It’s… It’s…
Yes.
Right?
It’s what you’re talking about.
It’s highlighting the pain and the tension and the…
[EXHALES] You know, the fact that it’s fleeting and it’s storytelling and…
I don’t know, that’s actually what I find beautiful about it, and…
That’s what I’m trying to do here, so…
That’s absolutely beautiful. I’m…
If that’s what you’re doing, yeah, sign me up. Wonderful.
Thanks, thanks.
Oh…
Well, um…
Yeah, I really do wish you the best.
Thank you.
Um,
and I’ll just be lurking around in the neighborhood.
Hopefully, I made my first customer.
Yeah. Yeah. Great. It’s so gorgeous.
Hope to see you…
Yeah. Bye.
Hey, I…
I don’t know, this…
I do need help. Do you want a job?
This is exactly what I wanted
to happen to me when I walked in here.
Yes.
Oh, God. Okay.
Wonderful. Great.
Okay.
I have to be out by 5:00 p.m. tonight.
I do have a dinner.
Tonight?
Yeah.
I just started working here.
Okay, perfect.
Great.
I’m gonna just need to wipe off a surface for this girl.
Here. There you go.
That’s, um…
Thank you so much.
It’s a real Ghostbusters situation in here, huh?
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
Hey. Frame it.
Aww.

Oh, my God. It’s still attached.
Oh, God, I can’t watch. [SCREAMS] Oh!

Nope.
MAN: [OVER PHONE] Babe.
Not at all.
Babe, the game’s over. Where you at?
Hi, honey. Sweetheart.
Where are you?
I’m at the shop with my boss.
And we need some help hanging something up.
I don’t like when you say “boss.”
Babe. You should be the boss.
Let’s buy the place and make you the boss.
Honey, you’re on speaker.
Yeah. Just… Oh, hi.
Just…
Hi.
I want you to know that they’re gonna be wearing onesies.
Because the bar gives free beer to the people…
I can see you.
…who wear onesies to the Bruins game, but they don’t always wear that.
I’m across the street.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God, babe, you are stunning.
ALLYSA: Can you bring my brother in, too?
Okay, I can’t take responsibility for either of the people who are about to come in here, just so you know.
[BELL ON DOOR JINGLES]
Hi.
Hi.
[KISSES] You look great.
This is Lily.
Hi. Lily. Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is my husband, Marshall.
I didn’t mean the boss thing.
That’s my brother Ryle.
[BELL ON DOOR JINGLES]
Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Lily.
Lily Bloom.
Mm-hmm.
Yes. Yes.
You guys know each other?
No.
A little bit.
No, we…
We met a few months ago.
We shared each other’s naked truths.
Ew. Aw.
That’s… Okay.
No, that’s…
MARSHALL: We’re adults.
That was a bad choice of words.
You said it.
You said “naked truths” first.
No, we just talked.
ALLYSA: You’re lying.
That’s what we’re calling it these days, “We talked”?
‘Cause we talk all the time.
Great.
We talk, like… We talk, like, three to five times a week.
Wonderful.
ALLYSA: Can I show you the work that I’ve done here?
We should talk? We can talk tonight.
LILY: No, we could hang this.
ALLYSA: No, let me take you over here.
MARSHALL: Let me talk to your sister over here.
ALLYSA: Okay.
MARSHALL: I mean, it is really good.
[LILY CLEARS THROAT]
[ALLYSA AND MARSHALL CHATTER INDISTINCTLY]
We meet again.
It’s good to see you.
So, this is the flower shop that my sister works at ’cause she’s bored, huh?
Oh, we like to say “inspired” here, um, but, yeah, this is, um…
You know, I… Yeah.
Yeah.
Looks like we will be seeing a little more of each other then.
Is that so?
MARSHALL: Babe, these are incredible.
ALLYSA: Thank you very much.
You’re even more terrifying in the daytime.
Same.
MARSHALL: Okay, guys, idea.
Let’s go have some dumb fun today.
[POP MUSIC PLAYING]
I’ve gone up to the roof a few times.
Hoping you might be up there.
I wanna see you again.
Well, now you see me.
You know what I mean.
[BOWLING PINS CLATTER]
MARSHALL: Okay. Let’s go, let’s go.
Mmm!
But that’s a bad idea, right?
Because of my sister, because of your business.
MARSHALL: Go, Lily!
Yeah, that’s a bad idea.
MARSHALL: Yep. Of course. This is you right here, babe.
[BOWLING PINS CLATTER]
No. Hey.
She’s off-limits. No, she’s mine.
I see you.
Hey.
It’s true.
So, we’ll just be friends then?
I like it.
Yeah, friends.
To friendship.
Yeah.
MARSHALL: It’s the weekend somewhere. Let’s go.
Oh, no. Please don’t leave, sir. Our Uber’s about to leave.
I love you. I’m gonna head home, honey.
No. no, no. It’s brunch in Singapore. Come on, Lily.
RYLE: Let me walk you home.
No, it’s fine.
I… I live around the corner.
It’s on the way.
ALLYSA: You live where we live.
Semantics.
Okay, fine, but only ’cause
you’d feel really bad if I got murdered.
Okay, don’t fish where I swim, Ryle.
I love you. See you tomorrow, Lil.
I appreciate you walking me, but you really didn’t…
I can’t stop thinking about you.
I’m right here.
Well, that’s the problem.
I thought we agreed to be friends.
We did.
But that was, like, hours ago.
[LAUGHS]
Can I just kiss you?
Oh, my God. You are pushy.
Just once. Just once.
That’s all I need to get you out of my system.
Oh, that’s it? That’ll do it?
One kiss.
Okay, well, good luck with that.
Is that a yes?
Just once?
Just once.
[LILY SIGHS]
Okay.
Okay.
Did that get me out of your system?
I’m gonna walk myself home, okay?
Bye, friend.
YOUNG ATLAS: Is this enough over here?
YOUNG LILY: Yeah.
Maybe add, like, a little right there.
YOUNG ATLAS: Okay.
YOUNG LILY: You’re just protecting the roots, you know, from the snow or in case it freezes over or anything.
I mean, the roots are the most important part of the plant.
Really?
Yeah.
I didn’t know that about roots. That’s cool.
Here, you want some?
Oh. [GIGGLES]
Thank you. Yeah, I’ll take that.
What made you wanna start growing things?
When I take really good care of these plants, they reward me with flowers and vegetables.
And when I don’t, they just shrivel up and die.
Kinda like us.
[SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING]
YOUNG LILY: What about that oak tree?
It doesn’t need anybody to grow.
Because it’s capable of taking care of itself.
No matter what, it will keep standing.
Strong and sturdy…
and yeah, it survives because it’s a goddamn oak tree.
[SIGHS]
[INDISTINCT ARGUMENT]
ANDREW: You embarrassed me.
You like the attention.
JENNY: Lily’s asleep upstairs.
Honey, please. Please, don’t!
[SLAPS]
[JENNY CRYING]
I heard what happened last night… with your dad and your mom.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
I don’t… Okay, yeah.
Does that happen a lot?
I’m sorry.
ALLYSA: Hey, Lily.
Do you wanna do the honors?
No. You go ahead. I wanna take it in from here.
I was hoping you’d say that. Okay.
Okay.
Hold on!
[SWITCH CLICKS]
Oh, my God.
This is insane.
Congratulations.
I couldn’t have done it without you.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, I don’t know what I was thinking. Thank God.
Oh, it’s incredible.
It’s perfect. It’s you.
It’s perfect. It’s great.
[SIGHS] Oh.
What if we don’t get any customers?
No, don’t do that. Your mom’s coming.
Oh, my mom.
She’s flying in to be a customer.
Yeah, I mean… Yeah, but how depressing would that be if the only customer we have is my mom?
Well, Marshall’s coming this afternoon.
So that’s two, so you’re good.
Okay, here we go. [LAUGHS]
Wow.
ALLYSA: Yeah.
This doesn’t even look like the same shop. Congratulations.
How’s it going so far?
I mean, we literally just opened, but…
So, that means your brother’s the first official customer?
Oh, you have to buy something to be considered a customer.
Right now you’re just loitering.
Good morning, Lily.
Good morning.
All right. I’ll take these.
Do you, uh, deliver?
Is that for a girl?
It is.
She might send them back, knowing her.
Right. Um, okay.
That little card, fill out the message on the front and then the back you put the person’s name and the address.
Okay.
So, are you bringing this mystery girl to my birthday party on Friday?
‘Cause I kind of, like, need to plan for that sort of thing.
I don’t know. Are you going, Lily?
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She has to go. She’s my best friend.
[CHUCKLES]
All right.
Thank you.
What do I owe you?
Oh, um, fifty-one even.
RYLE: Here you go.
LILY: Thank you.
This is a big moment.
Sure is.
Thank you so much for your service, uh… business.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
LILY: Um, thank you. Yeah.
RYLE: Hey, congrats.
ALLYSA: Get out. Thank you.
Good to see you.
RYLE: Bye.
ALLYSA: Goodbye.
Oh, my God. He’s such a dumbass.
He put the name of our shop as the delivery address.
Weird first customer.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER]
[R&B MUSIC PLAYING]
Oh!
ALLYSA: Lily.
LILY: Hello. Happy birthday.
Oh, my goodness.
You came. You look great.
I missed something important.
This is my… It’s a long story
Welcome to our casa.
You guys, this… I mean, your house… This is…
I can’t believe this is your house.
This is our humble abode.
I just wanted to do something low-key for baby girl over here.
ALLYSA: Oh, my God.
And to think I did not even marry him for the money.
You’re not in it for the money.
I’m not.
You’re my ride or die.
Yeah.
When we first met I was dead broke, and I was driving a Toyota Camry.
You still drive a Toyota Camry though. Right?
MARSHALL: The greatest automobile on earth.
ALLYSA: Yes, he does. Also…
Can’t convince me otherwise.
He thinks it makes him relatable.
It really does.
I’m a man of the people, okay?
Happy birthday. I’m gonna go grab a drink.
I’ll be right back.
Okay, thank you. Okay.
Yeah, you are a man of the people.
[POP MUSIC PLAYING]
Thank you.
You’re welcome.
You didn’t like the flowers?
Stop flirting with me.
Hi, may I have a scotch please? Thank you.
I can’t do that.
I thought we were friends.
We are friends.
Okay.
Excuse me. You’re on my hand. Thank you.
Hi.
Come on.
What?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You gotta… You gotta stop. You have to stop this.
Please.
What?
Just the, you know, staring at me like that and the…
I’m just looking at you.
Okay. You’re just looking at me.
Stop showing up at my flower shop and sending me flowers.
My sister works there.
Stop walking through this party, following me around.
You’re making me feel like…
Can you just shut up for one second?
Okay.
I like you.
What, are you five?
I’m trying here.
Go on.
Do you wanna go somewhere more private?
To talk?
To talk.
Okay.
[MOANS] No. No, no, no, stop.
[UNZIPS DRESS]
You want me to stop?
Mmm, no.
No.
Mmm. But yes. I don’t wanna have sex. Not tonight.
[RYLE SIGHS]
I know, I know.
But I don’t do casual, and I know that’s how you do it, but, um, I’ve, um, changed my mind. And I’m sorry.
I can’t do this.
[LILY SIGHS]
[RYLE EXHALES SHARPLY]
You okay? What are you doing?
Getting ready for bed.
We’re going to sleep.
[LAUGHS] Sorry, we’re… We’re what?
Going to sleep.
My God.
Do you mind?
Well, do you have something I can wear?
[LILY LAUGHS]
I don’t think you’ve ever done this before.
It was sexier in my head.
Pants?
You’ve got it.
Smart-ass.
[KISSES, CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
[EXHALES] Good night, Lily Bloom.
[DOOR OPENS]
[WATER POURING]
[DOOR CLOSES]
Ryle, I’m very nice, so I brought you coffee.
Oh!
Hi.
No.
Oh, no.
I understand.
ALLYSA: Oh…
It’s not as bad as it looks.
It looks pretty bad.
It kind of is.
Okay. None of my business. Uh, okay.
What… I’m… I’m gonna go.
Let me just say one thing.
This man runs through women like candy.
This is different.
Oh, is it? Wonderful.
Well, just in case it obviously is not, let me say that if you’re looking for, eh, nothing from him, that’s a great option.
LILY: Okay.
But if you’re looking for romance and you want a relationship, this is not the person, and it’s not about you.
And I love you.
LILY: Yeah.
ALLYSA: But let me just say…
Date me.
What?
Date me.
I’ve… I don’t…
What… What does that mean? I…
Okay, no. I’m gonna leave.
And I’m so sorry, but I was just bringing coffee, and now, I’m so embarrassed.
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] You can’t have any of that.
That’s for you.
I’m outta here.
A normal person would just leave and go to therapy.
[LILY EXHALES]
[DOOR CLOSES]
What are you talking about?
[SULTRY INDIE MUSIC PLAYING]
RYLE: I wanna try.
I wanna try.
LILY: Come on. You think you can do this?
RYLE: I have no idea.
But I definitely wanna kiss you again.
LILY: Well, that I can do.
Okay.
But don’t make me regret this.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[MUSIC FADES]
Hey.
[LILY MOANS SOFTLY]
Good morning.
Mmm, mm-mmm. You’ve already brushed your teeth.
That’s not fair.
[CHUCKLES]
So sorry. I gotta go in early.
Am I gonna see you tonight?
Oh.
No. Not tonight. My mom’s in town.
She’s obsessed with trying this new restaurant, Root.
It’s her dying wish to take me there.
Your mom’s in town?
Yeah. Yeah, no, she’s not actually dying. [LAUGHS]
It’s… I was just saying that.
It’s just, you didn’t, uh…
You didn’t tell me that.
Oh, um…
I’m sorry. I didn’t think you’d wanna know.
Is there room for one more?
[LAUGHS]
What?
Wait, you wanna meet my mom?
Is that a problem?
I mean, I don’t think it’s a good idea.
Mm. Ouch.
No.
No. I mean… [CLEARS THROAT]
It’s not because of you.
Mm.
It is because of her. This woman…
I just wanna meet the mother of the woman I love.
Hey!
Hey. Sorry, you forgot this. Bye.
Wait, wait, this isn’t mine.
I know.
[BREATHES DEEPLY]
I happen to love you too.
[ELEVATOR DINGS]
[GIGGLES] You’re gonna be late.
Get over me, my gosh!
I’m taken!
YOUNG LILY: Did you make this?
YOUNG ATLAS: Yeah.
Carved it from a branch from your old oak tree.
In case you forget.
Strong and sturdy.
Thank you.
GIRL: Gross. I bet she has rabies now.
[GIRLS LAUGH]
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Get up.
Get up. Get up. Get up.
Stop. No, no.
Come on.
[ALL GASP, WHOOP]
YOUNG LILY: Do you like to cook?
Yeah. I love it.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
YOUNG LILY: Mmm.
Smells great. What is it?
Hot chocolate cookies.
Dark chocolate with burnt marshmallows.
Ooh.
That’s good.
My mom would splurge on Swiss Miss for us at Christmas.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
That was her favorite.
[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING]
So, did you, um, did you kiss me earlier because you really wanted to, or was it mostly just to get back at Katie?
I just…
I really need some clarity here.
I wanted to.
That’s my dad.
That is my dad. You have to go.
What?
You… You have to go right now.
Don’t forget the cookies.
Okay. Okay. I got it. You gotta go right now.
Out the back door. Please, go.
Twelve minutes, okay?
Go, go, go.
Okay.
[DOOR CLOSES]
[ANDREW GRUNTS]
[CLEARS THROAT]
Hey!
Hi!
How are you, honey?
Good.
ANDREW: You all right? How was your day? Good?
Yeah.
Yeah, great.
ANDREW: Good. Busy?
[WATER RUNNING]
Yeah. Um…
ANDREW: Busy’s good.
[CLATTERING IN DISTANCE]
Um, I made cookies.
Yep.
Yeah, I’m starting to…
[CHUCKLES] Wow.
Pigs are flying.
Yeah. [CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHS]
Wish I didn’t love you so much.
Yeah, same.
[KISSES]
Okay. You gonna save me some?
Yeah, of course.
You promise?
Yeah, I promise you.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER]
LILY: My goodness.
Yeah, it’s amazing.
Hi. We’re just meeting her.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah. I am sorry in advance.
RYLE: No.
Yeah, no, no. Prepare yourself.
Hi! Hi, Mama!
I love this place!
It’s beautiful, right?
Oh, my God! It looks beautiful.
Let’s order cocktails.
Let’s. Yes. Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Mom, this is… this is my friend, Ryle, yeah, who I now sleep with. So, ha-ha.
Uh…
Ryle Kincaid. Nice to meet you, ma’am.
It’s so nice to meet you.
You know you said that out loud?
I do know I said that out loud.
Allysa, you know, who I work with?
JENNY: Uh-huh?
This is her brother.
Oh! Yes! Now I see a resemblance, sure.
Yeah.
Well, we both favor our mother.
Oh, here it goes.
That’s what everybody says about me and Lily.
Oh, you know, I see it.
Oh, yes.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
How lucky are you, Lily?
The luckiest.
How lucky am I?
Oh, my God.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Would you excuse me? I have a thing. I like to wash my hands a lot and…
Give me one…
Get out of here.
RYLE: I will. All right. All right. Bye-bye.
Leave us be. [CHUCKLES]
Oh, my God.
Mom, you know, we don’t need to do that.
You never told me you were dating the most beautiful man.
He’s got a good personality to make up for it, though, so…
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Uh, who is he? Where’s he work?
Don’t do that. Don’t.
What does he do? Don’t do what?
Hey, I am… I’m your mother.
Boston Grace Hospital.
Oh, no.
Stop.
WAITER: Welcome to Root.
No, please, don’t.
Can I get you something to drink?
God. Please. Thank you. I need alcohol.
Uh, I would like to try a negroni. I hear they’re delicious.
WAITER: They are. I’ll get you a negroni.
JENNY: Thank you.
WAITER: And what can I get you?
Oh, I’ll… Surprise me.
So, what’d I miss?
JENNY: Are you by any chance a doctor?
RYLE: I am. I’m actually gonna be performing a once-in-a-lifetime operation soon.
[VOICES DROWN OUT]
JENNY: Oh, my Lord. Is it dangerous?
RYLE: It’s a risky surgery.
It’s amazing though. He’s amazing.
RYLE: They’re five years old.
Thank you so much.
[CHUCKLES]
So tell me about Boston.
They were the best years of my life.
The food is really amazing there…
Yeah?
…and the harbor.
My uncle would take me fishing there sometimes.
Sounds like you miss it.
Yeah.
I’m gonna move there after the Marines.
Everything’s better in Boston.
Except the girls.
Boston doesn’t have you.
I’m gonna miss you.
Same.
I don’t know how you did it.
But somehow, you became my favorite person.
Same.
[SLOW INDIE MUSIC PLAYING]
YOUNG ATLAS: Hey.
What?
Are you sure?
Yeah. Yeah.
I don’t have a condom.
I have one.
You do?
It’s health class.
I’ve… I’ve never done this before. [INHALES DEEPLY]
It’s okay. I’m no expert.
Okay.
I’ve only done it once.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
RYLE: I’ve been studying them since they were born, since I’ve been a resident…
I’m gonna use the bathroom real quick.
Okay, honey. Okay.
LILY: Yeah.
You get to know each other. I’ll be right back.
Lily Bloom.
Atlas.
You look…
Yeah, you… You… You…
[CHUCKLES]
God, thank you.
I mean, my mom didn’t recognize you, so…
It’s probably for the best. [CHUCKLES]
God, right? Yeah.
What have you been up to?
Just working. Living.
Yeah, same.
Yeah. Did you go to the military or what…
Yeah, yeah. No, I did… I did eight… Yeah, eight years.
Wow.
Yeah. I got out and moved to Boston.
What are… [EXHALES]
What are… What are you doing in… in Boston?
Are you… You visiting here, or…
Oh, I live here.
[LILY CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
Yeah. Where everything’s better.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Is that your… your guy?
Yeah, that’s, um… That’s Ryle. He’s, yeah, he’s, um… he’s really special.
I think you’d really like him.
I’m so happy for you.
Yeah, thank you.
Do you have anyone, or are you married?
Or do you have a girlfriend or, you know, anything?
Yeah. I got Cassie.
Yeah?
Yeah, she’s great.
Oh.
That’s so good.
You look so well.
I, um… I don’t wanna get you in trouble or anything.
Well, how do I find you?
Um…
If I wanted to find you.
I… I mean, I… I opened my flower shop.
Lily Bloom’s.
Of course you did.
Yeah. Over in… in Back Bay.
So, you know, you can look me up sometime, or…
Um…
Yeah. Well, I… I gotta… Well, you know.
Yeah.
I’m working, so…
Okay. Get out of here.
[STUTTERS] Yeah, I’m gonna go. All right.
Okay.
[SLOW POP MUSIC PLAYING]
RYLE:…once-in-a-lifetime operation.
MARSHALL: Lily?
What are you drinking?
I’ll have wine, please.
You are not getting wine. You’re in a onesie.
You don’t get free wine with a onesie.
Fair point.
Whatever you’re having, I’ll have it.
Bingo!
Three beers and a water for my ladylove.
RYLE: Wait, did you just say “water”?
[MOUTHING] I’m sorry.
Okay, yeah.
We didn’t plan on telling you here…
Stop it.
Um, you know.
I’m gonna be a dad! [YELLS]
[ALL CHEER]
And I’m gonna be the mom.
MARSHALL: Yes!
I’m gonna be a dad!
I knew it.
No, no.
This is fucking crazy! I know!
LILY: I’m so happy for you. I’m so happy.
Yeah.
MARSHALL: I’m a papa.
I’m just so happy for you.
You’re gonna be the best mama.
Oh, my God.
To Allysa, who’s 11 months younger than me,
and you still teach me every day what being a grown-up looks like.
Cheers.
LILY: Cheers.
ALLYSA: Cheers.
Eleven months? You guys, I didn’t know you were so close in age.
Oh, yeah. Three kids in three years.
Makes you feel bad for our mom.
Three? You guys have a sibling?
Yeah. Yeah, we had an older brother, Emerson.
Um…
And he died when we were younger.
Oh, I’m so sorry.
MAN: Let’s go. Goal!
ALL: Yeah!
RYLE: Good morning.
You like frittata?
What is happening?
No, no, I feel like I’m in a porno. What… What is this?
[LAUGHS]
I did not know you could cook.
I can’t.
Oh, well, good, ’cause I was starting to get a little intimidated.
It was, you know, a little too good to be true.
That’s for you. Yeah.
That’s mine. Thank you.
I like a little hair of the dog. Don’t be shy.
It’s actually, uh…
This is just to celebrate my big surgery tomorrow.
Oh, my God, I’m…
I’m so sorry.
No, no, no.
I don’t know what I was thinking. I…
It’s fine.
It’s not fine. I’m sorry.
Hey. I am sorry.
Hey, what’s that mean? The heart.
Oh, God, it’s nothing. I just…
You know, one of those silly things you do.
No, it’s not nothing. Every tattoo means something.
Oh, I know. No, no.
This is just like one of those silly things you do in high school,
and I don’t know why I still have it.
[BREATHES DEEPLY]
RYLE: No.
It’s one of my favorite parts of you.
LILY: Mmm.
Okay. Baby?
Mm?
I have to tell you something.
Hmm.
Your frittata’s burning.
Shh.
It’s gonna be perfect.
Okay.
Well, what are some of your other favorite parts about me?
[RYLE BREATHES DEEPLY]
Your glabella.
LILY: Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Your flagina.
Oh, no! Stop!
[BOTH LAUGHING]
[ALARM BEEPING]
Oh, shit!
I told you. I’m sorry. I did tell you.
No, no. Baby, you need a potholder.

Hey, hey. You’re okay.
What was that?
What was that? No, no.
Can you give me a second, please?
Hey. Hey.
[GLASS CRUNCHES]
Just give me a second.
Oh, shit!
LILY: Are you okay? I’m sorry.
Oh, my God. Your hand.
No, don’t worry about my hand.
Baby, your surgery.
You okay?
I think so. I don’t know. [SNIFFLES]
Let me see it.
Shit, I’m…
I know. I’m hurt.
I knew we’d make a mess.
I’m so sorry.
It was an accident.
No. I didn’t… I didn’t… I didn’t…
[MUMBLES]
What did we do?
It was an accident.
I’m okay. [SNIFFLES]
[CAR DOOR OPENS]
God, I’m so sorry.
Hey.
Thank you for coming. Sorry I’m late.
Stop.
I’m a disaster.
No, here. I think I got everything.
Yeah, no, no, thank you. Okay.
How was the wedding?
Also a disaster. [CHUCKLES]
No.
It’s fine. It’s fine. It was a little, just…
How’s a wedding a disaster?
Well, I mean, their marriage is probably the disaster, but they’re fine.
They’re lovely. They deserve each other.
But the flowers were beautiful?
Yes, the flowers were off the char…
I’m so sorry. How was your…
How was your surgery? How did your sweet hand hold up?
It was awesome.
Really?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah. There was this moment, um…
[SUCKS TEETH]
Allysa and Marshall messed up.
We’re going to Root.
The place we went to with your mom. Um…
There was this moment, and I…
Well, hold… Why? Why?
I don’t know.
I know, but I was dying to try the new place…
Yeah, but they heard…
…and we’ve already been there.
…how we talked about it and…
Yeah, but we could just call them.
No. They’re already there.
No, I know.
They ordered 14 appetizers.
I really wanted to…
You know my sister.
…try the new place. I know. I’m sorry.
I will take you there next week.
You know I love food. That’s all.
You know I’m a creature of habit.
That’s all it is.
I’ll get the same thing I got last time.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean, it’s perfect. The food… The food is so good, so…
Hey. Hey.
What?
Hi.
Hi.
I’m sorry. It’s been a… It’s been a week. Um…
I don’t need to be complaining to you. You’ve been through it. Um…
Yeah.
Tell me. I wanna hear everything.
Okay.
Okay.
RYLE: Hmm.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Hi. Sorry.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
ALLYSA: Hi!
MARSHALL: What’s up?
I’m so sorry we’re late.
Just sit down. Don’t worry about it.
LILY: Can I have this?
Oh, yeah. Of course.
We’ve ordered so much food.
RYLE: We’re so sorry.
LILY: Yeah, it’s… it’s my fault.
Oh, baby.
I didn’t…
Ryle told me something happened,
but he didn’t tell me it was looking like this.
Look at you, honey.
It’s fine. It doesn’t even…
Yeah.
It doesn’t even hurt.
RYLE: It was a mess. You should have seen her.
Yeah. I mean, his hand. And he got hurt too.
So we’re… Yeah. We are.
Yeah. No, I’m fine.
I feel bad. It was… It was a beautiful mess.
Yeah.
MARSHALL: Wait, so, dude, what happened with the surgery?
Probably the greatest day of my life.
Twenty-seven hours.
Twenty-seven hours?
Yeah.
The only thing I’ve done for 27 hours is day-trade and play Call of Duty.
Do you guys have baby names?
Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt.
MARSHALL: And go on a DraftKings bender.
ALLYSA: Baby names?
Yeah, sorry. I was, yeah, thinking.
MARSHALL: We’re thinking something strong.
We’re gonna do big-time authors.
This riff…
R. L. Stine.
[LAUGHS]
MARSHALL: Judy Blume.
ALLYSA: That is going to be the demise of our marriage.
ATLAS: How we doing, folks?
ALLYSA: Hi.
How are you liking your appetizers?
Oh, wonderful.
I’ve had one bite of one thing and this is already my favorite restaurant.
What’d you go for?
The Brussels sprouts.
Ah, Brussels sprouts.
What about you? What do you like?
Oh, I’m… Impossible to choose.
Uh, my regards to the chef.
Thank you. Appreciate it. It’s actually my mother’s recipe.
ALLYSA: Oh.
MARSHALL: That’s very beautiful.
It’s my first restaurant. Yeah.
MARSHALL: Love that.
And I love the creativity, dude, seriously.
So…
I’m an entrepreneur as well, so I get it.
ATLAS: What’s… What’s your… What’s your deal? What’s your thing?
MARSHALL: Right now we’re looking to allocate capital in local Boston businesses,
and a place like this would just be amazing.
[VOICES DROWN OUT]
MARSHALL: Not to be too forward, but what are margins right now?
I mean, the place is jumping. Thirteen, 14, 15 percent?
But I love the story about your mom.
[IN NORMAL TONE] You do a Series A and scale this thing up.
ALLYSA: Honey.
MARSHALL: Did I offend him?
No, just keep saying “allocating capital.”
The chef was the asshole.
I have been holding it for so long.
I’m gonna go pee really quick. I’ll be right back.
Do you want me to come?
No, I’m good. I’m good.
Are you…
No, no, you… You guys keep talking.
I’ll be right back.
Come on.
What happened?
Come on, tell me. What happened?
Nothing. I… We… I… He burned his hand, and I fell.
I know. I know. It’s… It was an accident, though. It was…
[LOUDLY] That was an accident?
Yes. Shh.
Leave him.
God.
You gotta leave him.
I am not your mother, Atlas.
Leave him. Come on.
Are you turning into yours?
Let me out of here.
Lily.
Let me out now.
Lily.
Stop.
Wait, what is this?
LILY: Atlas! Stop.
Touch her again, I’ll cut your hand off and shove it down your throat,
you piece of shit.
Atlas, stop! Stop.
Stop.
Oh.
So this is Atlas.
Baby, hey.
The homeless boy…
Come on. Stop.
…you wasted your virginity on?

Excuse me. Ryle.
Ryle. Ryle, wait.
Ryle, please, wait.
What was he doing in the bathroom, Lily?
What was he doing in the bathroom?
He saw my eye, and I think he saw your hand.
And he knows it was an accident. And I told him it was an accident. He…
[PANTS]
Lily.
What?
I don’t…
I don’t know him.
I mean, we… we… We were kids.
I don’t know him now.
Anyone but him.
Anyone but him.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
I know you. Anyone but him.
[PANTING]
Promise me.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
I don’t know.
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
I’ve never been here before.
You have me. You have all of me.

So, if I’m not what you want, you just…
No, no, no. I’m fine.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop.

I know. I know. I know. I know.
I know.
I love you, Lily.
I love you, too.
No, please stop. No, please, please.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
ANDREW: Lily! Open the door.
You gotta leave right now.
Lily!
I’m coming!
Open the door!
Leave right now. Put your clothes on.
Who’s in there?
He’s coming. Come on.
Hey! Open…
[INAUDIBLE]
[DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES]
Thank you. Enjoy.
LILY: Thank you for coming by.
We appreciate it.
Bye.
Thank you.
Thanks so much for stopping in.
It’s busy.
ALLYSA: Yeah.
Whoo, I think that’s the last of it.
How you doing, mama?
I’m doing.
I’m doing.
You in that little dress.
Do you mind if I…
If I see the baby for a moment?
Oh, yeah. Have a visit.
Hi, bubba. How you doing? You getting big.
Hey, question.
If, um, we’re not allowed to go back to that restaurant…
Yeah.
…why is he allowed to come to this store?
I don’t…
Coffee.
Okay.
I’m getting coffee. Would you like some?
No, I’m good. Thank you.
Excuse me. Hi. Hey. Excuse me.
Hi.
ALLYSA: Thank you.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
This is incredible.
Yeah, thanks.
Kind of exactly, uh, how I imagined it.
Yeah, yours too.
Thanks.
Look at us.
So, look, I, uh…
I came by the next day after the fight,
but he was here. And I… I just didn’t think that was a good idea.
I just… I just wanted to say I’m really sorry.
I was out of my mind…
Yeah.
…and… and acted like a jackass and…
I just feel really bad and I’m sorry.
Yeah, yeah. No, it’s all good. It’s, um…
Yeah. It was a misunderstanding. So…
Well, I don’t… I don’t know. I mean, no, it wasn’t.
I don’t think it was.
Why are you here now? I gave you my address months ago.
What are you… What are you doing?
I came the next day.
I drive this street a lot.
Yeah.
[ATLAS SIGHS]
I’m sorry.
Are you happy?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I couldn’t be happier.
Are you?
No.
Sorry.
[SCRIBBLING]
That your phone?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
That’s my number. In case you need it.
Okay, well, I won’t, so…
But thank you.
I hope you don’t.
Hey, that, um…
That thing that he said about that…
You know, with us. It wasn’t…
It wasn’t wasted.
I know.
I was there.
[BELL ON DOOR JINGLES]
[ELEVATOR DINGS]
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
[SIGHS] Mmm.
That smells good.
Thank you.
Are you happy?
Um…
Are you okay?
Yeah. I’m just…
I’m just curious.
I wasn’t.
Lily, you make me happy.
Are you happy?
I mean, I don’t think anyone’s happy all the time, but, um…
I don’t know if I like the sound of that.
No, no. It’s just, you know…
Of course I deal with, um, you know, my stuff and, you know… [INHALES] …life, and ticking clock and, you know, all those decisions that…
Right.
…that women have to worry about.
But, I think I’m an innately happy person.
It’s probably just a coping mechanism I learned from my mom. So…
Your mom?
My dad used to hit her.
Shit, I’m so sorry.
You never told me that.
That’s not something people talk about.
Did he ever hurt you?
No. He nearly killed Atlas though.
[SIGHS]
Oh, my God. I’m so sorry.
Oh…
Oh, God.
I’m so embarrassed. I…
That mess at the restaurant.
I didn’t know. That must have been so hard on you.
Yeah.
Baby, all I wanna do in my life is protect you.
You know that, right?
When you hurt yourself by accident,
when you stub your toe, I blame myself.
It’s like it’s my fault that the wall was there.
[LAUGHS] Stop.
I’m the luckiest goddamn man on this planet.
And I could clean up. Trust me.
Okay. I’m not trying to hear about that.
You don’t wanna hear about that? Just a little bit?
No. No.
Yeah, I’m a ripped neurosurgeon for Christ’s sake.
When was the last time you saw someone who looked like me that wasn’t on a daytime soap?
[LAUGHS]
I mean, come to think of it, yeah, I… No, I haven’t.
Yeah.
And I’m rich.
Oh, and humble. [LAUGHS]
We can work on that.
God, I love you.
I know. I love you, too. That’s the problem.
RYLE: It’s a big problem.
Mm-hmm.
RYLE: It’s a really big problem.
LILY: Mmm.
[GROWLS]
[LAUGHS] Stop.
[INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA SYSTEM]
Look at her. She’s like a little alien.
Yeah, she’s perfect.
[BABY CRIES]
[ALLYSA SIGHS]
Do you want to hold her?
Yeah.
ALLYSA: I knew it.
Here you go.
RYLE: Okay.
RYLE: Hi.
MARSHALL: There we go. Right there.
Oh, you’re so beautiful. Hi.
RYLE: Oh, wow.
You’re a mama.
ALLYSA: Yeah.
Oh, my sister’s a mama.
ALLYSA: And you’re an uncle.
Wow. You did it.
[SOBBING] This is just hormones. Don’t look at me.
[CHUCKLING]
Do you guys want kids? Well…
MARSHALL: No pressure. We’re not… Not putting you on the spot right now.
I mean, it would be great for childcare and stuff like that.
I’m not gonna make her put on a white dress and have my babies.
Unless she wants to.
Then I would marry her tonight.
Oh, shit. He’s serious.
Oh, my gosh.
Ryle, you are… You’re drunk on baby smell.
No, no, no. I am serious as an aneurysm.
Oh, God. Please don’t do neurosurgeon humor when you’re propos…
I mean, if you are.
Is that… Is this…
ALLYSA: He’s going around.
LILY: I mean, if that’s what you…
Give me the baby.
MARSHALL: This is out of it…
Please stop.
Yeah. Wait.
No, no. No, no, stop. [LAUGHS]
MARSHALL: Oh, he’s doing it?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Okay. Okay. What…
[LILY CHUCKLES]
Can we just…
ALLYSA: Can you get the baby? We have a baby.
MARSHALL: We can take that. That’s ours.
ALLYSA: Give me.
Here you go.
ALLYSA: Here you go, baby. Shh.
You get back down there. You get back down there right this second.
[SIGHS]
Will you marry me, Lily Blossom Bloom?
Yeah?
MARSHALL: [LAUGHS] Okay.
ALLYSA: This is just… I’m just…
MARSHALL: He did it.
This is a miracle.
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God.
LILY: But we’ll do a proper wedding one day.
JENNY: You got married without me.
And I continue to be very sorry,
but at some point you’re gonna have to forgive me.
I will wear you down.
My wife will wear you down. Not possible.
I don’t think you should ever forgive her. Just saying.
Okay. That’s enough of that. Hold on, can you charge my phone?
I haven’t been dreaming about your wedding day your whole life, I’ve been dreaming about it my whole life.
And I’m sorry, I just feel cheated.
Yeah, okay. Got it. Thanks, Mom. Okay, we’re gonna find a way to move on.
If I don’t get to watch you walk down the aisle, I will not be denied watching you squirm.
You wanna make it up to me?
Yes, please.
Make me a grandbaby. No, three. Three. Make it triplets.
All right, can you just…
Can we move past this conversation, please?
[OBJECTS CLATTERING]
You okay?
What happened?
Mom, I’ll call you right back, okay? Okay.
Yeah, no, hang up.
[CALL DISCONNECTS]
Hey, what happened?
Hey, you okay?
I dropped your phone, and the case fell off.
[PAPER RUSTLING]
And I found this.
I called the number…
It wasn’t…
You promised me.
I know.
I would never lie to you.
I know. It’s nothing.
It’s nothing?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It’s nothing?
Yes. Yes, I promise.
Yeah.
Okay?
It’s nothing.

I promise. Please.
Stop! No, no, no.
No. I promise, please.
Lily, stop!
No, it’s… Please, just listen to me.
Please. I didn’t know he was coming.
You promised me, Lily. Stop.
Just talk to me. Please. Just…

You fell down the stairs.
No, no, no. Don’t… Don’t touch it.

And I, um… I… I tried to catch you.
No, Ryle, no.
You’re… You’re okay. You’re okay.

Do you know who you are?
Lily Bloom.
Okay. Where are you?
Our apartment.
Okay. Who am I?

And what am I doing right now?
Helping me.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Five.

And now? Okay.

ALLYSA: Lily! Oh, my God.
Did you see it? Did you see the magazine?
You did it! Look at this!
Top ten. We’re in the top ten!
We’re in the top… You did it.
Wait, where is it?
Where’s the genius? Right there. Look, look, look.
Right there. There’s you!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I’m gonna call Ryle and then tell him to get, like, 50 copies of this thing.
[ELEVATOR DINGS, DOOR OPENS]
Hey.
Hey.
You saw?
Congratulations.
Yeah, thank you.
I didn’t know it was a big deal, “Best in Boston.”
Best in Boston.
[BOTH MOAN]
Oh. Hello. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
Okay.
Mmm. I love this tattoo.
Hey, remind me what that means again.
Um, what?
I told you.
Really doesn’t mean anything?
Did you read it yet?
Yeah, did you?
Mm-hmm.
Mm. Will you read it to me?
I don’t like that kinda stuff.
Please.
No. Baby, I made dinner, and it’s gonna get cold.
Read it.
And I don’t love this kinda stuff, okay?
“Number seven, Lily Bloom’s.
An avant-garde floral shop… “What?
No, no. Skip to number one.
Our favorite restaurant.
Look, baby, I…
Read it.
[CLEARS THROAT]
“The top pick should come as no surprise…”
No, go to the end.
“The owner, Atlas Corrigan, spoke to the sweet origin story behind his farm-to-table hot spot, Root.
When I was a kid, I carved a…”
Carved what?
Baby, I don’t wanna read…
Keep reading.
“…small hollow heart from an oak tree for a girl.
So the name was meant to represent something she said to me, which I’m gonna keep between us.
But there was no other name for Root. It was… always for her.”
Baby…
[WHISPERING] Just go to this last paragraph.
It gets better.
I don’t wanna…
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Read it.
“When asked if he had seen the girl since they were kids, Corrigan replied…”
“…Corrigan replied… ‘Yes. Next question.'”
Do you love him?
I did.
Do you love him now?
I love you.
That wasn’t my question.
I don’t know.
[SIGHS]
Thank you.
Okay, baby.
Come on. Let’s have dinner.
No.
Okay. Please.
Hey, no, no, no. Not now. Please. Just…
Please. Hey. Stop, please.
Baby, stop. Stop.
You want me to stop?
Not now. Hey, stop it.
Mmh-mmh.

I don’t think I’m showing you how much I love you.
LILY: Yes, you have.
RYLE: No.
No, I haven’t.
Hands.
Yes, chef.
I was never gonna become her.
You’re not becoming her.
Don’t even think about that.
Okay?
[SIGHS] Yeah.
You’re not.
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah.
I wanna tell you something. I don’t know if it’s the right time…
DOCTOR: Sorry for the delay.
Been really busy tonight.
So, we have a certain examination for these situations.
It’s called the SANE exam. It’s completely optional, of course…
He didn’t…
No, I wasn’t… It’s…
Did he try?
I don’t need the exam. Thank you. Yeah.
May I?
Oh, yeah. Of course.
DOCTOR: Does this hurt?
LILY: Mmh-mmh.
DOCTOR: This?
LILY: Mmh-mmh.
No, it’s just the skin. Yeah.
So, usually,
I’d give you an X-ray on this collarbone to make sure that it isn’t fractured, but, given your situation, we’re gonna clean it up, and the nurse is gonna come in and give you a tetanus shot.
I… I don’t understand.
We don’t give X-rays to pregnant women unless it’s vital.
Okay?
Yeah.
Right. I’ll be right back.
Okay.
Okay.
[DOOR ALARM BEEPING]
LILY: There’s no Cassie, is there?
No.
No, there isn’t.
It’s, uh…
It’s the place.
Um, kitchen, living room.
Uh, hey, let me grab you some clothes.
Thank you.
My dad won’t even notice they’re gone.
Um…
Bedroom’s all yours.
No, I’m not gonna take your bedroom.
No. Please.
I have to get up early for work anyway, so…
I love that couch. It’s a good couch.
So, stay as long as you want.
Thank you.
Okay. Now, get some rest.
See you tomorrow.

[DOOR OPENS]
Hey.
Hi.
I wasn’t sure if you were hungry, so I went with a few fan favorites.
What song do you want at your funeral?
[LAUGHS]
If you had to pick one.
Have you not thought about this?
What song you’re gonna play at my funeral?
Yeah.
[LAUGHS]
At my funeral, I’m thinking Creed, “With Arms Wide Open”.
You know, “With arms wide…”
Yeah.
…as the casket’s being lowered.
[BOTH LAUGH]
You’re gonna be okay.
It doesn’t feel like it.
I know.
But you are.
I think it’s a little different this time.
If I can’t even take care of myself, then how am I, um, you know, supposed to take care of a baby?
That night I went to that old abandoned house, I didn’t go there because I needed a place to stay,
I went there to kill myself.
And I was sitting on the living room floor, and I saw you in your bedroom window.
The light came on, and you poked your head through that curtain, and as soon as I saw your face, I couldn’t do it.
The next day, you brought me food, you fed me…
I mean, you saved…
You saved my life is what I’m trying to say.
That’s who you are.
And if you decide to keep it… [GULPS]
…you are going to be an amazing mother.
And that baby is so lucky.
You’ve got this.
[ENGINE STOPS]
ATLAS: Lily.
If you ever find yourself in the position to love somebody again, just fall in love with me.
Yeah. Okay.
ALLYSA: I’m so sorry.
[SIGHS SOFTLY]
I’ve been watching him my entire life, and I’ve seen… how afraid he is of opening his heart to anyone, ever since he was a kid.
And I think I felt that he was dying inside.
Just dying inside, little by little, until he met you.
And I’m not making any excuses, uh…
I never… I never thought he was capable of this.
Um…
Would it… Would it be okay if I asked what happened to Emerson?
Of course.
You deserve to know, and it’s our family.
Um…
My father had a gun.
Ryle and Emerson were playing in the house, you know, pretending to be cowboys, and they found it.
And Ryle was six-years-old.
He was a six-year-old boy.
[ALLYSA SNIFFLES]
He didn’t even know that it was a real gun.
He thought that it was pretend… [SNIFFLES]
…until it was too late.
Emerson was our brother…
I’m so sorry.
…his best friend.
[ALLYSA SOBS, SNIFFLES]
He’s never been the same since.
Yeah.
To be at that funeral…
I really did used to love flowers.
Listen to me.
As his sister, I wish more than anything that you could find a way to forgive him.
But, as your best friend, Lily, if you take him back, I will never speak to you again.
I’m so sorry.
You’re the best friend I ever had. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
I’ll be an even better auntie.
Sweetheart.
[MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING]
[CELL PHONE BUZZING]
This side?
That side.
Yeah, if I hold it in like this, I think it’ll be a little easier.
Righty tighty, I think.
Yep. Come on.
I’m sorry.
No, no. You got it.
Your dad always did this stuff.
Oh, I’m sure you built a thing or two in your life.
No. No, no. That was always his domain.
It doesn’t wanna go in there.
Um…
Why did you stay with him?
[JENNY SIGHS]
It would’ve been harder to leave.
And I loved him.
[SIGHS]
Yeah, me, too.
I think I got it.
[HEARTBEAT THUMPING SOFTLY]
DOCTOR: And that’s the heartbeat.
LILY: Mmm.
Look at that. Do you wanna know?
You can tell already?
I can.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay.
Can you see that?
DOCTOR: That’s her little head.
Oh.

Yeah. Emerson.
That way, we can call her Emmy.
What do you think?

It’s not for you or me. It’s for her.
[EMMY COOING]
Yeah, you know.
Look at her.
What if, one day, she came to you and said, “My boyfriend hit me”?
What would you…
What would you say to her?
Or if she said, “Daddy, my husband pushed me down the stairs, but he said it was an accident, so it’s fine.”
Or if she said her husband held her down and she begged him to stop, but he swore he’d never do it again?
What would you tell her?
If the person she loved… was… was hurting her, what would you say to her?
I would beg her to leave him.
Yeah.
And I’d beg her never to go back.

[Motor Whirring]
[Motor Stops]
[Shouting] See how it’s done?
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.
You better.
Boss’ll chew my head off if these cores get messed up.
Don’t worry.
We’re at 26 feet.
You let Jason operate the drill?
Yeah, he can handle it.
[Motor Slows, Stops]

[Yelling]




I got you!
[All Shouting]
What were you thinking?
[Sighs]
What’s happening?
The whole damn shelf is breaking off!
That’s what’s happening!
[Cracking, Rumbling Continue] 
[Jack] What we have found locked in these ice cores…
is evidence of a cataclysmic climate shift…
which occurred around 10,000 years ago.
The concentration of these natural greenhouse gases in the ice cores…
indicates that runaway warming pushed the planet into an ice age…
which lasted two centuries.
[Speaking Foreign Language]
I’m confused.
I thought you were talking about global warming, not an ice age.
Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can trigger a cooling trend.
Let me explain.
The northern hemisphere owes its temperate climate to the North Atlantic current.
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator and is carried north by the ocean.
But global warming is melting the polar ice caps and disrupting this flow.
Eventually, it will shut down.
And when that occurs, there goes our warm climate.
Excuse me. When do you think this could happen, Professor?




When? I don’t know.
Maybe in a hundred years. Maybe in a thousand.
But what I do know is that if we do not act soon…
it is our children and our grandchildren who will have to pay the price.
And who’s going to pay the price of the Kyoto Accord?
It would cost the world’s economy hundreds of billions of dollars.
With all due respect, M r. Vice President…
the cost of doing nothing could be even higher.
Our climate is fragile.
At the rate we’re burning fossil fuels and polluting the environment…
the ice caps will soon disappear.
Professor, um, Hall…
our economy is every bit as fragile as the environment.
Perhaps you should keep that in mind before making sensationalist claims.
Well, the last chunk of ice that broke off…
was about the size of the state of Rhode Island.
Some people might call that pretty sensational.
[Men Chuckling] 
[People Shouting] Stop global warming!
[Man] I’m here at the Global Warming Conference in New Delhi…
where, if you can believe your eyes, it’s snowing.
The coldest weather on record…
has thrown the city into chaos with numbers of homeless people…
Taxi! Taxi!
I enjoyed your testimony, Professor. It was very spirited.




Oh, thank you. It’s what we’re here for, right? Put on a good show?
Quite. Uh, I was wondering if I could talk to you…
about your theory on abrupt climate shift.
The name’s Rapson. Terry Rapson.
Professor Rapson? Of the Hedland Center?
That’s me.
I’ve read your work on ocean currents.
What do you say to a spot of tea?
Absolutely.
If we can hail a cab.
Oh.

slamming into the unprepared island chain… [Phone Ringing] 
With a cataclysmic force never before witnessed.
Meteorologists already believe this…
[Ringing Continues]
To be the strongest hurricane ever recorded…
a storm that will surely… Are you gonna get that?
Hello?
I just saw that Sam got an “F” in Calculus.
I’m aware, Jack. I get a copy of his report card, too.
Well… Sam is a straight “A” student. He doesn’t fail classes.
All right. I don’t have time to talk about this right now.
[Jack] Well, maybe you oughta make time.
Excuse me. I’m not the one who’s away for months and months at a time.
[Sighs] I just don’t understand.




I’ll let him explain it to you. Can you take him to the airport in the morning?
Sam’s getting on a plane?
He joined the scholastic decathlon team. They’re competing in New York.
Sam joined a team?
Yeah, I think there’s a girl involved.
Oh.
Look. Can you pick him up at 8:30?
I gotta go, ’cause I’m on call tonight.
Jack, please don’t be late. I don’t want him to have to take a taxi again.
All right. Okay. I’ll be there. Okay?
I’ll be there. [Sighs]
[Woman On P.A. I This morning’s weather staff meeting has been moved…

[Woman Continues, Indistinct] 
Jack!
I know you have an innate talent for rubbing people the wrong way, Jack…
but why, for the love of God, would you aggravate the vice president?
Because my 17-year-old kid knows more science than he does.
Perhaps, but your 17-year-old kid does not control our budget.
It doesn’t matter if he hates you.
My son doesn’t hate me.
You’re missing the point. What I’m trying to tell you is that…
if Raymond Becker pulls our budget… Where…
Oh, shit!
Jack!
[Horn Beeping] 
Oh, my God. [Horn Beeping] 
Hi, Sam. I’m sorry I’m late. Dad, it’s fine.
The cab’s already here.
That’s okay. I’ll take care of it.
What are you gonna…
Here you go.
[Jack] I’m not angry. I’m disappointed.
[Sam] Do you wanna hear myside of it?
How can there be two sides?
I got every question right on the final.
The only reason Mr. Spengler failed me was ’cause I didn’t write out the solutions.
Why not?
I do ’em in my head.
Did you tell him that?
I did. He didn’t believe me.
He said that if he can’t do them in his head, then I must be cheating.
Well, that’s ridiculous! How could he fail you for being smarter than he is?
That’s what I said.
You did?
How’d he take it?
He flunked me, remember?
Oh. Yeah.
Sam, I’m sorry. I jumped to conclusions.
I’m gonna call this guy, have a word with him.




We’re gonna get this whole thing straightened out.
Don’t worry about it. Sam!
Sam!
[Man] Parker, this is Houston.
We’re seeing some bad weather over Canaveral.
Doesn’t look like you’re coming back this week.
[Chuckles] Your wife’s gonna give me an earful.

He’s afraid of flying.
I’m fine.
[P.A. Dings] 
You know, statistically…
the chance of a plane going down because of turbulence is less than, what? One in a billion?
Or is it a million?
I can’t remember if it’s a million…
Shut up, Brian.
Listen, Sam. Don’t pay attention to him, okay?
Everything’s fine. They’re still serving drinks.
[P.A. Dings]
[Man] Folks, it appears we’re gonna…
have a little bit of a bumpy ride here for the next few minutes.
Please fasten your seat belts and put your tray tables and seat backs…

I know.
[Both Chuckle]
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey. Hey, hello. Bye-bye.
[Man] The cause of this extreme weather remains a mystery…
although some meteorologists believe sunspots are to blame.
This is very odd.
There’s a buoy here registering a 13 degree drop in ocean temperature.
Oh, yeah. That’s right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.
I’ll put a call in, see if there are any ships near Georges Bank to get it.
This buoy isn’t in Georges Bank. It’s just off Greenland.
[Man] What?
What are the odds of two buoys failing?
Remote.
Make that three.
[Horns Honking]
[Man] Just another typical day in New York City.

Sure. That’d be great. Could you hold this for a sec?
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks.
Man, you got some serious competition.
[Sam] Please.
I’ll bet he’s really rich, too.
Shut up.
[Phone Ringing] 
Who is it?
Terry Rapson here. Sorry to call you so early.
No, Professor. That’s all right. What is it?
Well, we’ve found something extraordinary…
extraordinary and disturbing, that is.
You recall what you said in New Delhi…
about how polar melting might disrupt the North Atlantic current?
Yes.
Well…
I think it’s happening.
What do you mean?
One of our NOMAD buoys…
registered a 13 degree drop in surface temperature the other day.
I sent you an e-mail.
Hold on.
At first we thought it was a malfunction…
but there are four more across the North Atlantic showing the same thing.
[Jack] This is unbelievable.
You predicted it would happen.
Yes, but not in our lifetime. This is too fast.
There are no forecast models remotely capable of plotting this scenario…
except yours.
My model is a reconstruction of a prehistoric climate shift.
It’s not a forecast model.
It’s the closest thing we have.
Nothing like this has every happened before.
At least not in the last 10,000 years.
As I predicted yesterday, the swell off Hurricane Noelani is incredible.
These waves are even bigger than I imagined. Just take a look.
[Ringing]
Shouldn’t you be monitoring the weather or something?
This is L.A. What weather?
[Motor Running, Faint] 
Wait. What’s that noise?
What noise?
[Motor Running, Louder] 
[Motor Stops]
[Phone Ringing]
[Sighs] Honey, I’ll be right back.
[Woman] The coastguard has closed the beaches…
as waves have been too big for even the most experienced of surfers.
L.A. Weather Center.
It’s Tommy! I’m down at the beach!
I’m in the middle of something. What do you need?
There… Ooh! Uh.
There’s… There’s hail the size of golf balls coming down here!
[Tommy Continues, Indistinct] [Man] Low pressure system moving along…
the California coastline is creating a cyclonic system across the L.A. basin.
[Phone Ringing]
Yeah. Hello.
Hey, boss, turn on the Weather Channel.
I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
What are you talking about?
[Woman] Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting…
windspeeds in excess of 70 miles per hour…
Hold on a second.
Conditions that are highly unusual for California.
Tom, we’re building a forecast model. We’re gonna need what?
Priority access to the mainframe for two days, maybe three.
Oh, is that it? Anything else?
We need it immediately.
I would say that you’ve lost your mind…
but you’ve been this way for the past 20 years.
Tom, this is important.
What is this forecast model you’re building, if you don’t mind my asking?
[Tom] Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.
Janet’s a, uh, hurricane specialist with NASA.
Jack’s a paleoclimatologist, and I have absolutely no idea what he’s up to.
Booker! What’s going on, here?
They just issued a tornado warning in Los Angeles.
[Man] Breaking news, as we prepare to go live to Los Angeles.
Mixed reports…
The report’s just come in.
Some extreme weather occurring in the area.
Okay, we’re now going live to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.
[Woman] We have live coverage now from our Fox 11 chopper.
Are you there, Bart?
Uh, yes, I’m here.
These tornadoes are forming so fast… What?
[Bart] Oh! Oh, my God! Lisa…
Are you getting this on camera? This tornado just came and erased the Hollywood sign.
The Hollywood sign is gone. It’s just shredded.
[Wind Roaring]
[People Screaming]
[Lisa] Bart, what can you see? Is anyone hurt?
[Bart] I wouldn’t be surprised. There is so much damage down there.
And there are people down there taking pictures!
Hey! What the hell are you guys doing!
Go for cover! You can’t stay here! Get outta here!
What you’re seeing are two actual tornadoes striking Los Angeles International Airport.
Wait. Wait. It looks like they’ve joined and formed one large tornado.
Tommy!
Oh, my God!
[Man] Urge all of our viewers to stay away from the area.
Jeff, where are you?
I’m on, uh, Yucca and Vine. I’m on my way in now.
Jeff, you’re on TV! You’re right in the middle of it!
God. Oh, my God!
You gotta get out of there, man!
Oh.
[Bart] That bus just got dropped on top of that Porsche!
[Line Busy Tone] Oh, my God. I hope no one was in that car!
[Woman] And for our national audience just joining us now…
we are going live to downtown Los Angeles right now.
Tommy?
If you look over there behind me, that’s a tornado.
Yes! A twister in Los Angeles.
It’s one of the many tornadoes that are destroying our city.
There’s another one! That’s the Los Angeles skyline!
It’s unbelievable! It’s huge! I’ve never seen anything like that!
[Gasping]
What’s happening?
It-It-It looks like some sort of huge…
horrific, terrifying nightmare, only this is the real thing!
[Rumbling Stops] 
[Wind Howling] 
[Car Alarms Blaring] 
Yes, I-I’m looking at it right now.
Yes, it is.
What’s happening, Raymond?
I’ll call you back. Mr. President.
Los Angeles has been devastated by a series of tornadoes.
On top of that, the F.A.A. wants your approval to suspend all air traffic.
What do you think we should do?
Until we can figure out what’s going on here, I don’t think we have much choice.
[Woman] What you’re seeing is what’s left of downtown Los Angeles.
Hey, man, I just got off the phone with my mom.
Um, excuse me, you guys. I’m really sorry, but we need to change the channel.
[Chattering]
[Woman] The F.A.A. has grounded all air traffic in the United States.
Unfortunately, the order came too late…
for two planes that were brought down by severe turbulence in the Midwest.
So much for one in a billion.
[Chattering]
All right. All right. Listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please. We’ve got a lot of work to do and we don’t have much time.
So, let’s get started, please. Vorsteen?
All our grid models are worthless.
I don’t think grid models are gonna be a lot of help here.
The Canadians are reporting tremendous circulation moving down from the Arctic.
In Siberia, there’s a low pressure system unlike anything we’ve seen…
and Australia just saw the strongest typhoon ever recorded.
[Man] Hang on. Are you saying that these things are interconnected?
[Booker] We have to consider the possibility.
The only force strong enough to affect global weather is the sun.
What’s NASA have to say?
We’ve already checked. Solar output is normal.
What about the North Atlantic current? [Vorsteen] What about it?
I got a call last night from Professor Rapson at the Hedland Center.
He thinks the current has changed.
[Murmuring]
Come on, Jack. How could that be?
The current depends upon a delicate balance of salt and fresh water.
We all know that.
Yes.
But no one has taken into account…
how much fresh water has been dumped into the ocean because of melting polar ice.
I think we’ve hit a critical desalinization point.
[Murmuring] 
It would explain what’s driving this extreme weather.
Hedland had some pretty convincing data.
They’ve asked me to feed it into my paleoclimate model to track the next set of events.
Hold on, Jack. Are you suggesting these weather anomalies are gonna continue?
Not just continue… get worse.
I think we’re on the verge of a major climate shift.
[Murmuring] 
Tom! What are you gonna tell the administration?
What do you expect me to tell them?
The government has to start making long-term preparations now.
Jack, all you have is a theory.
Then give me the mainframe and let me prove it!
No.
You have 48 hours.
[Sighs] Professor Hall.
Yes?
I think your theory may be correct.
Walk with me.
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored the strongest hurricane on record.
The hail, the tornadoes… it all fits.
Can the model you’re working on factor in storm scenarios?
Oh, we haven’t had the time.
Maybe I can help.
Welcome aboard.
Thanks.
Hi, I’m Jason.
Hi.
Ow!
Do you have the results of Peter’s C. T. scan?
Yeah, the treatment shrunk the tumor 20%.
Is his eyesight better today?
No. No change.
Hey, Peter. How you doin’ today?
A little better.
Good.
Let me listen here.
Can you read that?
No, but I remember the story from the pictures.
You do?
My mother used to read it to me.
She must be very proud of you. You’ve been such a brave, big boy.
Thank you.
You’re welcome.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Jack, you’ve been working for 24 hours straight…
the only one who hasn’t taken a break.
[Sighs]
Maybe I’ll try to shut my eyes for a while.
Call me when you get the results.
Frank, is he always so obsessive?
[Together] Yes.
Does he ever lighten up?
No.
Not really.
How long have you been working together?
Well, uh, Frank’s been working with him since the Stone Age.
I’ve only had to endure two years of servitude.
Jack. Jack. We got the results.
Six to eight months. That can’t be.
That time scale isn’t in months. It’s in weeks.
[Man] Widespread flooding has slowed transportation…
and caused numerous closures, including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.
The plumbing in the school is really old.
With all this rain, the sewage got stopped up.
Where are you staying tonight?
They’re finding us a place to stay with kids here in New York City.
Are you sure you can’t get home any sooner than tomorrow?
Well, look, Dad, I would if I could, you know.
It’s just, uh…
Ugh! This smell is unbearable, Dad.
Stop kidding around. I want you home.
Dad, I’ll be on the train.
Do me a favor, okay? Just don’t worry about me. I’ll figure it out.
[Sighs] All right, son. I’ll see ya tomorrow.
Hey, Sam. Guess what. We got a place to stay.
Great.
So far, the terrible weather hasn’t hit the D.C. area…
but local residents aren’t taking any chances…
as people stock up for what is already being billed…
as the worst storm season on record.
You better be sure about this, Jack. My ass is on the line.
You saw the model.
And I hope to God it’s wrong.
Oh. Mr. Vice President.
Tom.
You know Professor Hall.
Yes, we’ve met.
Uh, Professor Hall has some new information I think you should take a look at.
We just got these results from our simulation model.
They explain what’s causing the severe weather.
I’ll look at this later. I have a meeting with the director of FEMA now.
This is very urgent, sir. Our climate is changing violently.
It’s going to happen over the next six to eight weeks.
I thought you said this wouldn’t happen for another hundred years or so.
I was wrong.
Well, suppose you’re wrong this time.
I wish that I were, but I’m sure that you’re aware of what’s happening all around the world.
We’re making all the necessary preparations for this storm. What more do you expect?
You have to start thinking about large scale evacuations right now…
especially in the northern states.
Evacuations?
Yes.
Have you lost your mind, Hall? I have to go.
Mr. Vice President, if we don’t act now, it’s going to be too late.
Come on, Jack.
Hey, thanks for bringing us here.
I couldn’t let you leave New York without seeing the Natural History Museum.
Of course not. It’s the world’s finest collection of stuffed animals.
Hey, guys. Check this out.
“The body of this mammoth was found perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra…
“with food still in its mouth and stomach…
indicating that it froze instantly while grazing.”
[Man] It’s been 24 hours now since the snow started falling…
across the British Isles and over northern Europe…
and it shows no signs of letting up.
No. No, no, no. You gotta stop worrying. No.
It’s fine. We got plenty of supplies with us. We’re just snowed in.
Yeah. No, it’s all right. It’s all right.
You stay where you are, okay? I’ll be fine.
Yeah, I love you too. Okay. Bye. [Sighs]
Hey. How’s Jeanette?
Oh, fine.
Ferry just landed. Must be nice in Spain. I wish I was there.
[TV: Reporter] The search and rescue team has been deployed by helicopter…
to airlift the royal family to safety.
You think they’ll come get us, since we got snowed in?
Not likely.
Luckily, we got our own genny…
enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.
Oh, we’ll be fine. As long as the loo doesn’t back up again.
[All Chuckle]
In Ireland, those remaining in Belfast and Banbridge have been urged to evacuate…
to Dublin as soon as possible.
The north continues to receive the worst of the storm…
[Helicopter Approaching] 
[Man] We’ve got zero visibility. Maintain heading and speed.
[Man #2] What’s our heading?
Zero, three, five, sir.
Approximately 40 kilometers from Balmoral Castle.
[Man] We’ve lost visual contact with you.
This gauge here can’t be right.
[Man #3]  Wind speed has dropped to zero.
We have vertical walls of cirrus cloud formations.
[Man] What the hell is going on?
Bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze!
[Men Shouting] 
Port engine pressure’s dropping! The rotor R.P.M. is dropping!
We’ve got a flame-out on the starboard side as well!
Prepare for crash landing!
Select emergency fuel!
Come on, you bastard!
Come on!
[Breathing Heavily]
[Rapson] What I’m about to tell you is supposed to be confidential.
Several hours ago, three helicopters went down over Scotland.
They crashed because the fuel in their lines froze.
At what temperature does…
[Rapson On Speaker] Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit. We had to look it up.
The temperature dropped phenomenally fast.
On the ground, people froze before they could get out of their cars.
Get me a satellite picture of Scotland two hours ago.
Yeah.
We’ve got mountains of data but nowhere near enough computer power to analyze it.
Can you help us?
Send us what you’ve got, and we’ll do our best.
[Rapson] Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.
This is Scotland at the time the temperature dropped.
[Frank] This thing looks just like a hurricane.
[Janet] Only hurricanes don’t form overland.
Good evening, sir.
Hey, Harold.
Thanks, Victor. I’ll see you in the morning.
Right, sir.
Terrible weather.
Tell me about it.
Wow.
You live here?
Just on the weekends. It’s my dad’s place…
and he’s kind of never around, so…
Where is he?
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.
Is this you and your brother?
Oh, yeah. That’s when we took a bike trip together.
It’s been raining like this for three days now.
[Thunderclap]
[Horns Honking, People Shouting]
I’m just standin’ here.
You can’t stay here.
I never liked this neighborhood anyway. [Dog Barking] 
It’s a mob scene here at Grand Central Station.
Over half the platforms are flooded…
and service has been suspended on all trains.
With planes still grounded and trains now out of service, that’s bad news…
Victor’s coming to pick me up. Do you guys want a ride to the train station?
Stranded since this morning.
Not anymore.
In Nova Scotia earlier, the ocean rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.
What we have feared for the past few days has indeed happened.
The cold front moving down from the Arctic…
has created an enormous storm system in Canada…
which, incredible as it sounds, looks like a tropical hurricane.
I gotta go pick up my little brother. Do you guys want a ride?
Where is he?
He’s in a boarding school in Philadelphia.
If this system moves south, we could see a wind-driven storm surge…
that could threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.
Okay. Bye. Victor’s stuck in traffic on Fifth Avenue.
It’ll be easier to head out of town if we meet him over there.
All right.
You mean walk? No, not in this.
[Thunder Rumbling] 
We should take the stairs.
We’re on the top floor.
I guess we’re walkin’.
[Thunderclap] 
[Horns Honking, People Shouting]
Maybe we should just stay here.
I think the young lady is right, sir.
No. We need to get home.
Come on! [Shouting Continues]
[Goats Bleating]
[Growls]
Hey, Cesar, come here.
What are you doing?
The wolves! They’re gone!
[Man On News] Just to give you an idea of the situation…
which seems to be becoming worse with each passing minute…
at the moment, we have flooding in most parts of the island.
We’ve got traffic snarl-ups because the electricity is now out…
to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals, car accidents… at least 200…
and Lower Manhattan, we’ve been told, is virtually inaccessible.
[Man] No one is to be on the streets. Please go inside.
[Excited Chattering]
Sir, just calm down.
Public library’s right up here. Make your way up there. You can stay warm and dry.
[Chattering Continues] 
Sir, just take it easy.
Um, can you call Mom? Please phone her for me.
Hey.
[Blubbering]
That dog can’t come in here.
Come on, man. It’s pouring out there.
I don’t care. Read the sign.
It’s supposed to be a public library.
[Excited Chattering] 
Come on, guys. This way.
Excuse me. Your bad.
Goddamn $ 1,500 waterproof raincoat!
Please shut up, man.
There must be rats everywhere.
That’s ’cause it’s New York.
Hey! Hey! Open up, big poppa!
It’s out of service. It’s out of service!
No, no. I’ll give you $ 100 to put it in service. You don’t have to do that.
No, no. Really, $200. I won’t have it. I won’t have it.
Oh, God, I love buses. This is just so much fun.
[Shouting]
Hello?
I can’t reach my driver. I lost the signal.
This is insane. We should just go back to your apartment.
[Brian] Yeah. I vote for that.
What? Are you kidding? We have to get higher!
Come on. Up to the library.
[Man] Calm down!
[Shouting In French]
I can’t understand what you’re saying.
[Shouting Continues] 
Just stay calm, ma’am. I will get you out.
[Screams]
[Man] The door is jammed!
[Shouting Continues]
I don’t speak French.

Hey, where is Laura?
[Woman Speaking French]
She was just right there.
She’s right there! Right there! See?
What… What is she doing?
Tell them to cover their eyes.
[Speaking French]
[French]
[Grunts]
[Child Screams] [Thunderclap] 
[Man On News] There is a wall of water coming towards New York City!
Everybody…
[Shouting, Screaming]
[Woman Screams] 
[Shouting Continues]
[Shouting In French]
What’s the problem?
She left her bag in the cab. Their passports.
[Officer] Forget about it!
I’ll get it for her.
Come on!
Oh, my…
Laura!
Laura!
No! No!
No, Sam! Sam, no!
Laura! Laura! Laura! Come on!
[Gasps]
Come! Come on!
Sam!
Go!
[Dog Barking] 
Professor.
Thank you.
[Chuckles] Is that Neville’s handiwork?
Neville’s way beyond stick figures. He’s six already.
Hmm. No. This masterpiece…
belongs to my second grandson, David.
Can’t believe Neville’s six already.
You won’t believe how fast they grow.
Professor, I’ve got Jack Hall on the phone.
They’ve run the data we’ve sent them.
Here he is.
Jack, were you able to re-create the thermal cycle?
Yes. The storm’s rotation is pulling super-cooled air down from the upper troposphere.
But shouldn’t the air warm up before it reaches ground level?
It should, but it doesn’t. The air’s descending too rapidly.
Is this an isolated incident?
I’m afraid not.
We’ve located two other supercells in addition to the one over Scotland.
There’s one over Northern Canada and another one over Siberia.
And do we know their projected path?
Yes. Our previous estimates of six to eight weeks weren’t even close.
This one storm is going to change the face of our planet.
Here’s a projection of 24 hours out.
This is 48 hours out.
Andin seven to 10 days.
When this storm is over, we’ll be in a new ice age.
My God.
Professor, it’s time you got out of there.
I’m afraid that time has come and gone, my friend.
What can we do?
Save as many as you can.
[Feedback On Line]
[Disconnect Signal]
[Phone Ringing] 
Jack. Something’s happened in New York.
No. The power is out. I’ve been in here all day.
[Officer] Who needs help?
Over here. Over here.
[Indistinct Shouting] 
Hi.
[Man] Hello.
[Dog Whimpering]
What?
This is the last one. Enjoy it. Greedy.
[Operator] All circuits are busy.
Listen. Thanks for coming back for me.
It was really brave.
I guess I better return her bag.
[Speaking French]
Sam? Just tell her how you feel.
Yeah.
[Dialing Phone] 
Did you reach your little brother yet?
No. There’s still no service. Damn cell phones.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Are there any payphones on the upper floors?
No. No.
But there are some on the mezzanine.
Great.
But I think it’s underwater.
Where are you going?
The power’s out.
Older pay phones draw their power directly from the line.
[Woman On P.A., Indistinct] 
Oh, God. I’ve been trying to reach Sam.
So have I.
I kept trying to call you, but I couldn’t get through.
It’s been a madhouse around here. Come on.
Are you sure about this?
Ah. Oh.
[Dial Tone] 
It works.
I love that picture.
Yeah. So do I.
Where was that taken?
Miami.
Well, where was I? I don’t remember that trip.
Sam and I went with my sister. You were in Alaska, doing research on your doctorate.
[Sighs]
Remember what he was like when he was that age?
[Chuckles] Everything was “one more.”
One more bedtime story. One more ride on my shoulders.
“One more, Daddy.”
Jack? Sam’s on the phone. Line four.
Sam?
Dad!
Where are you? Are you all right?
We’re at the public library.
Sam, it’s Mom. I’m so happy you’re okay.
Mom, can you call Laura and Brian’s parents and tell them we’re all right?
Yes. Of course.
Sam, what’s that noise?
Sam? Sam?
[Gasping] What is going on out there, Dad?
Sam? Sam, listen to me. Listen very carefully.
Forget what I said about trying to head south.
It’s too late for that. The storm is just gonna get worse.
It’s gonna turn into a massive blizzard with an eye in the center, like a hurricane.
Uh-huh.
The air is gonna be so cold…
you could freeze to death in seconds.
Sam?
What should we do?
Listen to me, son. Do not go outside.
Just burn whatever you can to stay warm and try to wait it out.
I will come for you. Do you understand me? I will come for you.
[Shivering]
Sam! Sam, come back!
[Jack] Sam? Sam, did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
Sam? [Sobbing]
Tell me he’s gonna be okay.
He’s gonna be all right. He’s gonna be all right. Do you understand me?
[Sobbing Continues]
[Gasping] 
[Shivering, Panting]
[Sobbing] I thought you drowned.
Let’s find some dry clothes for you.
Yeah.
Where did you store the arctic gear?
You can’t make it to New York, Jack.
I’ve walked that far before in the snow.
This is not the same. Jack, this is not the same!
Lucy, tell him.
I have to do this.
I know.
My hands are shaking. Shaking.
That’s okay. Here. Here. Come here.
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?
I’m using my body heat to warm you.
If we let the blood from your arms and legs rush back to your heart too quickly…
your heart could fail.
Where… Where did you learn that? [Shivering]
Some of us were actually paying attention in health class.
How are you feeling?
Much better.
Frank told me about Sam.
I’m not gonna try to talk you out of going…
but there’s something I need for you to do first.
You have to explain your results to the administration.
I already tried that.
I know this time will be different.
You’re gonna brief the president directly.
[Officer] Is that the last of it?
[Laura] Yeah. Pretty much.
Okay.
We also found this radio, but I don’t think it works.
Let me see it.
[Barking]
Buddha, be quiet!
You ain’t even supposed to be in here anyway.
[Barking Continues]
[Loud Rumbling]
[Rumbling Continues] 
[Barking Continues] 
Come on, guys.
Oh, my God.
[Glass Shattering] 
The basic rule of storms is that they continue…
until the imbalance that created them is corrected.
In this case, we’re talking about a global realignment.
The superstorm will last seven to 10 days.
When it’s over, ice and snow will cover the entire Northern Hemisphere.
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.
The earth’s atmosphere will restabilize…
but with an average temperature close to that of the last ice age.
What can we do about this?
[Sighs] Head as far south as possible.
That is not amusing, Professor.
Where do you suggest they go?
The farther south they go, the safer they’ll be.
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren’t flooded. Mexico would be best.
Mexico? Maybe you should stick to science and leave policy to us.
Well, we tried that approach. You didn’t want to hear about the science…
when it could have made a difference.
What exactly are you proposing, Professor?
Evacuate everyone south of that line.
What about the people in the north?
I’m afraid it’s too late for them.
If they go outside, the storm will kill them.
At this point…
their best chance is to stay inside…
try to ride it out…
pray.
What do you think he’ll do?
I don’t know.
Jack, thanks.
And good luck.
You too.
We’re all gonna need it.
We can’t evacuate half the country…
because one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.
Every minute we delay is costing lives.
What about the other half of the country?
If Professor Hall is right, sending troops north will create more victims.
We need to save the people we can right now.
We take the same approach in triage on the battlefield.
Sometimes it’s necessary to make difficult choices!
I don’t accept that abandoning half of the country is necessary.
Maybe if you would’ve listened to him sooner, it wouldn’t be.
Bullshit. It’s easy for him to suggest this plan. He’s safely here in Washington.
His son is in Manhattan.
I just thought you should know that before you start questioning his motives.
We’re going to follow Hall’s plan.
General.
Sir.
Give the order for the National Guard to evacuate the southern states.
Yes, sir.
[Door Closes] 
Vivian, uh, get me my wife.
[Wind Howling] 
[Generator Chugging] 
Sorry, mates, but we’re just about out of petrol.
Hey, is there any chance…
that it will run… on this?
[Chuckles]
Are you mad?
That’s a 12-year-old scotch.
[Laughs]
Gentlemen. To England.
To mankind.
To Manchester United.
[All Laughing]
I just… I just wish I could’ve seen him grow up, you know?
The important thing is he will grow up.
Amen.
Maybe you should have somebody help you with that.
Sir, I am president of the electronics club…
the math club and the chess club.
Now, if there’s a bigger nerd in here, please point him out.
I’ll just leave you alone to work on it.
Come on, Buddha. Come on. Do your business.
Look. There’s nobody around.
[Buddha Whimpering] 
Okay. You know what? I’ll turn around. I won’t look.
I promise.
[Barking]
[Barking Continues] 
What?
Hey, man. There’s people out there. I was walking my dog.
There’s hundreds of ’em. They’re walkin’ on the snow.
[Chattering] 
[Officer] Where are they all going?
They’re gettin’ out of the city before it’s too late.
All right, everybody. Quiet down.
When was the last time anyone got a signal on a cell phone?
I got through to my cousin in Memphis an hour ago. They’re being evacuated to the south.
We should get moving too. The water’s frozen over enough to walk on.
We should get going before the snow gets too deep.
Everyone, wrap yourselves up as fast as you can.
We shouldn’t go. We’re leaving in five minutes.
Why not, Sam?
When I talked to my dad, he told me we should stay inside.
The storm will kill anybody caught in it.
Then you have to say something.
I know.
[Officer] Line up. That’s it.
[Chattering]
Excuse me, sir. You’re making a mistake.
What? Hey, listen, son. We’re all scared here, but we got no choice.
That’s not it.
Get ready to go.
If these people go outside, they will freeze to death!
Okay. What is this nonsense?
It’s not nonsense, all right?
Look. This storm is gonna get worse…
and the people who are caught outside, they will freeze to death.
Where are you getting this information?
My father’s a climatologist.
What are you suggesting we do?
We stay inside, we keep warm, and we wait it out.
The snow is getting deeper by the minute.
We’d be trapped here without food, supplies.
It’s a risk. Yeah.
An unnecessary risk.
No, no, no. It’s not.
We’ve wasted enough time talking about this. Come on, people. Let’s go.
Look. Look. Look. Just look for a second.
Come on, everybody. Let’s get going.
One second.
The storm is gonna get bad. It’s gonna get really bad.
You’re not gonna be able to survive in it.
Believe me. Sir, please just stay.
Just stay.
Just don’t…
I’m…
[Wind Howling] 
She’s set to go.
Come on. Straight to the back, guys.
[Jack On Phone] It’ll be impossible to reach each other.
Leave a message for me at the American Embassy in Mexico City.
Okay. I will.
I love you.
I love you, Jack.
Tell Sam I love him so much.
God be with you.
[Line Disconnects]
Dr. Hall?
Yeah.
We haven’t been able to reach Peter’s parents.
I’m gonna try later, okay?
Okay. Thank you.
I got it.
You’re supposed to be on a bus heading south.
I’ve been watching your back for 20 years.
You think I’d let you go alone?
All these years, I thought I was watching your back.
Where are the keys?
In the truck.
Where do you think you’re going?
Neither one of you knows how to navigate worth a damn.
Without me, you’ll end up in Cleveland.
I’ll try to give you updates on the storm as it heads your way.
Good luck, Jack.
[Engine Starts] 
[Woman Reporting] Breaking news from the U.S.-Mexico border.
Just half an hour ago, Mexican officials closed the border…
in the light of so many U.S. refugees who are fleeing south…
in the wake of the approaching storm.
These people came here in anticipation of crossing into Mexico.
Instead, they’ve been met with closed gates…
[Man Reporting] And now, in a dramatic reversal of illegal immigration…
thousands of people are crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico.
The scene that’s unfolding here behind me is one of desperation and frustration.
People have abandoned their cars, grabbed their belongings…
and they are wading across the river illegally into Mexico.
Here it is.
Oh, this fireplace probably hasn’t been used in about a hundred years.
All right.
What are you doing?
What do you think we were gonna burn?
You can’t burn books.
No. Absolutely not!
You wanna freeze to death?
I’ll go get some more.
I’ll help you.
I’m going with them.
Okay. Do you have a cafeteria or a lunchroom?
Just an employees’ lounge with a few vending machines.
[Buddha Barking] 
We’re not gonna last very long on M&M’s and potato chips.
What about the garbage cans? There’s always somethin’ to eat in the garbage.
[Buddha Whimpering] 
Friedrich Nietzsche. We cannot burn Friedrich Nietzsche.
He was the most important thinker of the 19th century.
Oh, please. Nietzsche was a chauvinist pig who was in love with his sister.
He was not a chauvinist pig.
But he was in love with his sister.
[Brian] Uh, excuse me. You guys?
Yeah. There’s a whole section on tax law down here that we can burn.
Afterhours of uncertainty, the traffic is moving smoothly from the U.S. into Mexico.
This is only possible because the president was able to negotiate a deal…
to forgive all Latin American debt…
in exchange for opening the border.
Now multitudes of American families are feeling…
[Quiet Reading]
Lucy.
[Stops Reading]
Is Peter’s ambulance here?
No.
Why?
They’ve all gone.
What?
In the confusion… I don’t know what happened.
People just started to panic, and they left.
Now, there’s a policeman with a snowplow. He’s waiting outside.
Peter can’t be moved in anything but an ambulance.
I called and left a message for the county ambulance service.
Okay.
You should go, and I’ll stay and wait.
Lucy, no. No.
You should go. He’s not gonna wait forever.
It’s okay.
I’m sorry.
It’s okay.
All right.
[Gasps]
Are you all right?
Yeah. I’m fine. I just cut my leg the other day.
[Radio Static]
Did you get a signal?
Yeah. For a minute.
And?
Man, this storm is everywhere. It’s hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.
Europe is buried under 15 feet of snow.
And they say it’s gonna get just as bad here.
I mean, I don’t think your dad’s gonna make it.
No. He’ll make it.
He’ll make it.
[Man On News] The White House has ordered…
the following national disaster alert for all northern states:
Continued exposure to the approaching storm is deadly.
Remain indoors and take all measures to stay warm…
burning any fuel sources until the storm is over.
Roads are impassable across New York State…
and as far south as Pennsylvania.
Where are we?
[Man On News Continues, Indistinct] 
Looks like we’re just north of Philadelphia.
[Man On News] Rescue workers say they have no idea…
Look out!
You guys okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Once again, roads across the northern states…
Sorry, boss.
Are impassable.
Unpack the snowshoes. We’re walking from here.
Come on, men. Let’s get up and get going.
We’ve only made it to Brooklyn. Maybe we should just turn back.
What for? Half the city’s frozen underwater.
There’s nothing to go back to.
It’s time to get up. Keep moving.
We should’ve stayed in the library.
Come on, men.
Okay, guys. Let’s get moving.
Wake up.
What are you doing?
Insulatin’.
Newspaper’s best, but this’ll do it.
You know, you spend some years on the streets, and you learn how to keep warm.
Hey.
Thanks.
I got one. Your favorite vacation?
Besides this one?
[Chuckles] All right.
I went to Greenland with my dad on one of his research trips a few years ago…
and, uh, the ship broke down and we got stuck.
And it rained constantly.
That sounds really boring.
It was actually really nice.
Just me and my dad hanging out for 10 days.
[Sighs]
[Grunting, Screaming]
[Groaning, Whimpering]
[Jack] Frank!
Are you all right? I’m fine!
Just dropped in to do a little shopping.
I gotta lose this sled.
Hold on! We’ll pull you up!
Jason! You gotta support Frank’s weight!
Okay! I’ll try!
[Grunting]
Okay! I think I have his weight now!
I’m coming to you!
[Glass Cracking] 
[Grunting, Whimpering]
The glass is breaking!
Too much weight!
It’s not gonna hold.
No! No!
Frank! I can get you out!
[Jack] Don’t do it!
No! Frank! Don’t!
Frank, no!
Frank!
[Woman] What have you got there?
A Gutenberg Bible.
It was in the rare books room.
You think God’s gonna save you?
No.
I don’t believe in God.
You’re holding on to that bible pretty tight.
I’m protecting it. [Book Lands On Fire] 
This bible is the first book ever printed.
It represents…
the dawn of the Age of Reason.
As far as I’m concerned, the written word is mankind’s greatest achievement.
[Scoffs Quietly] You can laugh.
But if Western civilization is finished…
I’m gonna save at least one little piece of it.
[Radio: Chatter] 
We heard somebody was left behind.
[Sighs] We brought an ambulance.
Thank God.
Thank you so much for coming.
[Shivering]
[Laura Coughing] 
Hey.
Hey, are you all right?
You look like you have a fever or something.
I’m fine.
I just can’t sleep.
My mind keeps going over all those worthless decathlon facts.
It’s pretty stupid, huh?
No, it’s all right. I guess you just haven’t had time to adjust yet.
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?
Everything I’ve ever cared about…
everything I’ve worked for…
has all been preparation for a future that no longer exists.
I know you always thought I took the competition too seriously.
You were right.
It was all for nothing.
No… [Sighs] No, I just…
I just said that to avoid admitting the truth.
The truth about what?
About why I joined the team.
I joined it because of you.
Hey.
[Radio: Chatter, Indistinct] 
Get this convoy moving now.
[Whispering] I know. I know.
Mr. President.
All right.
I’m sorry, sir. We can’t wait any longer.
We’re the last ones.
All right.
[Pilot] Mexicali Control, this is Delta 2-6.
We’re carrying an urgent message for high command.
Request priority on landing zone one.
[Chattering, Shouting] [Radio Chatter Continues, Indistinct] 
Sir.
Thank you, Corporal. Carry on.
Madam Secretary?
Raymond.
The president’s motorcade got caught in the storm.
They didn’t make it.
She wouldn’t wake up this morning.
I-I… I mean, last night she only had a fever. I don’t understand.
God, she’s awfully pale.
Well, guys, look. none of us has had anything real to eat in days.
[Jeremy] I’m telling you, it’s hypothermia.
How could it be hypothermia?
We’ve all been…
Maybe it’s just the flu, you guys.
No, no, it’s not the flu.
Yeah? And how do you know?
Books can be good for something other than burning. Let’s go over her symptoms.
I told you. She has a fever and a really cold sweat.
[Woman] How’s her pulse?
It’s really fast.
Did she have any injuries, like a cut or something that might have gotten infected?
She was complaining about a cut on her leg a few days ago.
I didn’t… I didn’t think anything of it.
Oh, my gosh.
That’s blood poisoning.
Um, septicemia. She could go into septic shock.
I’ve seen that before. That can get bad.
She needs a massive dose of penicillin…
or a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately…
or…
Or what?
I’ve never seen anything like it. There’s no point of reference.
All I can see is cloud cover.
What are you doing?
Taking infrared image of thermal currents…
sent to Houston, Korolev…
your weather service.
[Parker] I’ll help you.
Tom? Tom, wake up.
[Groans]
I just received some satellite images from the space station.
You’d better take a look.
How big is this thing?
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter and growing.
The two cells over Europe and Asia are even bigger.
[Tom] Good God.
This one’s gonna hit New York inside an hour.
[Gasping, Panting] Jack…
Jason!
Are you all right?
Jason!
[Panting, Gasping]
[Barking]
What are you doing?
There’s gotta be medicine on that ship.
I thought you said it was too dangerous to go outside.
I know I did.
Where’d you find those chairs?
Why?
I’m going with you.
Me too.
[Gasps]
There!
[Lock Rattling]
Ohh! Come on!
Damn it!
[Grunts Loudly]
[Growling]
[Grunting Continues] 
[Yells]
[Panting]
It’s all in Russian. I… [Sam] I know.
H-H-Hey, guys, I found it.
What? How do you know?
Because it says “penicillin” on the bottom.
[Growling]
Wait. This is the mess hall. We should find some food while we’re here.
We don’t have time.
None of us are gonna survive without food, including Laura.
Okay.
[Exhales, Clears Throat]
[J.D.] Sam, over here!
What?
Bingo.
[Laughs]
[Sam Laughs] 
[Glass Clattering] 
[Inflating Loudly]
[Yelling]
[Sam] Brian?
[Brian] I’m okay.
[J.D. I What happened?
Okay, okay. All I did was open up a cupboard.
[Quiet Snarling] 
We can use it. Put food in it.
[Loud Snarl] 
[Gasps]
[Growling] 
[Panicked Yelling]
[Continues Yelling]
[Grunting]
Pull him in! [Wolf Whimpers] 
[Whimpering, Growling] 
You all right?
[J.D. Groans] My leg.
Here, use this.
[Shuddering, Groaning] Oh, yeah. Here. Ohh!
It should be over New York by now.
Satellite readings are showing a temperature drop of 10 degrees per second.
[Sam] You guys, I think we’re in the eye of it.
We gotta get back right now.
Look, I’m gonna go outside…
and I’m gonna lure the wolves out of the room.
When they leave, you lock the door.
Good luck.
[Crunch] 
[Growling]
[Yelling]
Aah! [Gasps]
[Muttering, Grunting]
[Growling, Snarling]
Aah! [Panting, Gasping]
[Wolf Whimpers] 
[Panting]
[Groans] Brian, hurry!
[Muttering] Come on! Hurry!
[Snarling, Growling] 
[Groans, Panting]
[Growling Continues] 
[Banging On Door]
Brian! Brian, open the door!
We have to get out of here now. Brian, get the supplies.
[Grunting, Panting]
[Ice Cracking]
Let’s go!
Pull! Pull, Brian!
Come on! Pull!
Take the medicine to Laura!
[J.D. Groaning, Yelling]
We’re almost there, man! Come on! Aah!
[Grunts]
Brian, close the door!
Don’t let the fire go out!
What’s happening?
Buddha, come away from the door!
Come, Buddha, come!
More books! More books!
How long have I been out of it?
Couple hours. How do you feel?
Okay.
What happened?
Well, we had to get inside in kind of a hurry, so I sort of pushed you in.
I should be used to you pushing me around.
Good to have you back.
What are you doing?
The eye of the storm has passed…
and we’re 40 miles from Manhattan.
Shouldn’t we wait one more day?
Sam may not have one more day.
What do you think’s gonna happen to us?
What do you mean?
I mean us. Civilization.
Everybody.
Mankind survived the last ice age.
We’re certainly capable of surviving this one.
All depends on whether or not we’re able to learn from our mistakes.
I sure as hell would like a chance to learn from mine.
You did everything you could.
I was thinking about Sam.
Jack, you know the chances of Sam…
I made my son a promise.
I’m going to keep it.
[Man On Radio] Parker, this is Houston. Do you read?
Roger, Mission Control. Go ahead.
We’re getting scattered reports that the storm is dissipating over North America.
Can you confirm?
[Parker] Affirmative. It’s finally clearing.
We’re over Europe right now.
I can see landmass for the first time in days.
How much further is it to the library?
It should be…
right here.
I’m sorry, Jack.
Sam?
Who is that?
My father.
You made it.
Of course I did.
[Crowd Shouting] 
[Shouting Continues]
Mr. President.
I just received a shortwave radio transmission from Jack Hall.
He made it to New York.
He says there are survivors.
Thank you, Tom.
That’s…
That’s good news.
[Becker] These past few weeks have left us all… with a profound sense of humility… in the face of nature’s destructive power.
For years we operated under the belief… that we could continue consuming our planet’s natural resources… without consequence.
We were wrong.
I was wrong.
The fact that my first address to you comes from a consulate on foreign soil… is a testament to our changed reality.
Not only Americans… but people all around the globe… are now guests in the nations we once called the Third World.
In our time of need they have taken us in and sheltered us… and I am deeply grateful for their hospitality.
[TV: Becker Continues] We mourn the loss of a spirited leader… whose courageous orders to evacuate to the south…
Peter.
Saved millions of lives.
Hey. You feeling okay today?
For days now we have despaired about the fate of the people who are trapped in the north.
Today there is cause for hope.
Only a few hours ago I received word… that a small group of people survived in New York City… against all odds and in the face of tremendous adversity.
I’ve ordered an immediate search-and-rescue mission to bring them home… and to look for more survivors.
Jack! It’s good to see you!
Come on. Let’s go get on board.
Look at that.
What?
Have you ever seen the air so clear?"

So, who is the woman in the station wagon?
Beth.




Mr. Keenig…
“Herr König.”

‘Ö.’ It’s not an ‘E.’
‘Ö.’ “Herr König.”
[GIRL, COMPUTER VOICE] Where’s Gretchen?
Gretchen and the movers are right behind us.
Okay, so, she’s not your mother?
No, she’s Beth.
Ah, okay.
And what is going on with your sister?
She deaf or something?
No.
But she can’t speak. It’s fucking annoying.
[ENGINE HUMS, TURNS OFF]
You okay, honey?
The nice man who owns this place will take us to our new home.
Oh!
[IN GERMAN] Good afternoon.
[IN GERMAN] Good afternoon, Mr. König.
Ah, very good, Luis!
You’ve been practicing, huh?
How was your journey?
Oh, very pleasant, thank you.
We almost forgot how beautiful it is here.




Ah, we almost forgot how beautiful you are, Beth.
Oh, stop!
[LAUGHS] Keep going!
Gretchen, come say hi.
Gretchen.
[GRETCHEN] What’s up?
[BETH] Oh, Jesus.
[MR. KÖNIG] Nice to meet you. Willkommen.
Thank you.
No, thank you, Beth.
We are so glad to have you back.
And please do not worry about your late arrival.
I completely understand.
[BETH] We have something for you. [LUIS] I’m sorry.
It’s…
The original sketch.
We drew that up
the night that you showed us the land you acquired.
Beth, that is…
[LAUGHS] Well, we will display this in the new guest lodge.
Oh! [LAUGHS]
[MR. KÖNIG] You know, you two lovebirds stumbled into my nest
almost eight years ago to the day.
And I believe there were more
than just architectural plans that were conceived this day.




[EVERYONE LAUGHS] [MR. KÖNIG] Hello, Alma.
[COMPUTER VOICE, IN GERMAN] Hello. It’s nice to meet you.
[IN GERMAN]
The pleasure is all mine.
[IN ENGLISH] Your German is already better than your father’s, huh?
[COMPUTER, IN GERMAN]
Yes. [IN GERMAN]
Ha! She said yes.
[LUIS] Ja, ja. [EVERYONE LAUGHS]
[GIRL, ON PHONE] Hey, Gretchen. How are you holding up?
I wish we could have spent a little more time together after the funeral,
but I get it.
You’re all over Europe with your dad’s family, huh?
Don’t forget you have a band that needs your voice.
Anyway, I’m sending you the new mix.
I knew your mom would have loved it.

[WOMAN] Hello there!
My name is Bonomo. I’m your neighbor.
I have my hands full.
Oh, me too.
Are you the housekeeper?
No, I’m a daughter.
Oh, really?
Haven’t heard about you.
Are you from England as well?
No, I’m not.
Why would you have heard about me?
[KÖNIG] I told…
[GRETCHEN, HUSHED] Jesus.
Forgive me, my dear.
Didn’t mean to startle you.
I told Dr. Bonomo about your family.
Dr. Bonomo is the medical superintendent of the local hospital
and also the chronic disease treatment facility,
which I am also funding.
This is Gretchen.
Gretchen.
Yeah.
Gretchen is from the United States.
It has been decided that she is moving in with her father.
What a pleasant surprise.
[VOICE RECORDING] Hi, you have reached the Vanderkurt residence.
Neither Gretchen nor Olivia are here now,
but we are dying to hear what you have to say,
so get ready to say it.
[BEEP]
Hi, mom.
I know this is weird, um…




But it’s good to hear your voice.
Going with dad was a bad idea, and I miss our house.
I’m short on money, but I’m gonna try to come home soon.
[KNOCKING]
[LUIS] I know it’s been tough.
But we are very happy you’re here.
[KNOCKING]
[MR. KÖNIG] Excuse me.
Gretchen, my dear.
I, uh…
I’ve been thinking, for a young woman like you there’s, uh…
not so many things to do here in the summer, and so…
I have a little idea.
A proposal.
How would you like to come work for me at the resort?
[LUIS] Oh, Herr König…
[MR. KÖNIG] Well, it’s an easy job,
and it will give you something to do
while your parents build a new resort for me.
I could use some more English-speaking staff.
[LUIS] Herr König, I think Gretchen…
I would pay you an appropriate salary, of course.
[LUIS] I don’t… [GRETCHEN] Yeah, sure. I’ll do it.
Oh.
Schön.
Wonderful.
Come by the reception tomorrow.
[WOMAN] Here’s your ID badge, sir.
Would you like to pay with cash or credit card?
Cash, or credit?
Cash.
[WOMAN, WHISPERING] “That will be 45 euro for a single room.”
Uh, that will be 45 euro for a single room.
Oh, and this is Beatrice
and I am Gretchen.
[IN GERMAN] Can I go now?
[IN FRENCH] No.
You can help me teach Gretchen how to sell things in the shop.
You have to be polite and friendly, even if the guest is rude.
And remember to put up the sign if you go to the bathroom.
But if you have any real trouble, just call the boss.
He lives up the resort street, on the hill.
He lives in a vacation bungalow?
No, he has a villa way up there.
He bought the hotel,
and so the bungalows are basically in the front yard of his villa.
Weird, right?
Super.
[WOMAN RETCHES AND PUKES]
[PANTS]




[MAN, IN GERMAN] I’m so sorry.
[IN GERMAN] No problem.
[HUSHEDLY] This happens sometimes.
[MR. KÖNIG] How’s your first day, my dear?
Can’t complain.
And how is your German coming along?
Not good.
This is okay.
You know, there are English-speaking schools
over the border, in Italy.
[WOMAN COUGHS IN THE DISTANCE]
Well, I’ll be along to pick you up in one hour.
Oh, I have my bike.
Oh?
No.
No, no, no.
No, it will be too dark on the country roads by then.
This is why you will not work late.
You will help Beatrix with the peak times.
[BEATRICE] What?
I thought we were going to split the evening shifts.
[MR. KÖNIG] You have a car.
I have a life, too.
Beatrix, I will not get drawn into another debate with you.
I don’t wanna have a debate with you.
No. Every time I raise an issue with you,
there is something you have to say about it.
I do everything you ask!
No.
What? I work every day late shifts!
You’re blasting your Scheisse music on the car radio on your way to work.
I hear it across the forest.
This is a nature reserve

Your sister?
She’s not my sister.
Oh.
Come on now.
I’m sure she really wants you to be her sister.
She had a chance at getting one but she ate her twin.
It’s called vanishing twin syndrome.
It’s when one fetus dies in the early stages of the pregnancy
and then the surviving fetus absorbs the dead one.
I always thought it was kind of badass.
But yeah, she’s a bitch.
Okay.
Another reason to not have kids.
Thanks for finishing my shift.
Erik and I haven’t been on a date in ages.
Here’s my master key.
There’s only one. Don’t lose it.

Gretchen.
I want you to lock up the doors and wait for me,
and I’ll come pick you up right now.
Uh…
Yeah, Herr König, it’s fine.
There’s a confused guest and I need to go check on her.
But I have my bike here, so you don’t need to pick me up.

[POLICE SIREN]
[ERIK] I started bleeding.
The woman stood there until the police arrived.
I was chased.
[STAPLER STAPLES] Fuck!
It’s really important that your statement is as accurate as possible.
The receptionist,
she stated that she did not see any woman in the parking lot.
May I suggest…
we change the last part into…
“The woman stood there until Mrs. So-and-so entered the room…
“Then the police arrived.”
That is so much better.
I think…
you are the victim of a prank.
[LUIS] Everybody is very nice here, honey.
It’s best we run some tests,
but this is actually very common.
Dad.
Gretchen?
What happened?
Did you fall?
Yeah, that’s not the important part.
Your sister had some kind of seizure.
We need to get her checked out.
Dad, I was attacked.
By who?
I don’t know, the cops think it was a prank…
A prank? Did somebody hit you?
No, I fell, but… [BETH] Gretchen?
She fell, it’s okay.
[DOCTOR] We are going to do an MRI…
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]
[DR. BONOMO] It might be childhood epilepsy.
Epilepsy?
It might be?
It means it might be genetic and not caused by an injury or tumor.
The cause itself isn’t life-threatening.
Well, that’s good.
Yeah.
The better news is I’m the superintendent
of the chronic disease treatment center up here.
What’s causing the seizures?
There are many possible triggers for a seizure in a child.
Fever. Certain lights.
Certain sounds. A change in hormone levels.
But Alma is too young for that.
Has there been a stressful event or disruption in your family lately?
[VOICE RECORDING] Hi, you have reached the Vanderkurt residence.
Neither Gretchen nor Olivia are here now,
but we are dying to hear what you have to say,
so get ready to say it! [BEEP TONE]
[GRETCHEN] Mom, this place is completely fucked.
Alma keeps freaking out, and they say she has epilepsy or something.
I think Dad is blaming me.
[REGISTER DINGS]
I’m coming back home.
I got the money.
[MAN] What happened to you? [GRETCHEN] Jesus.
Uh, I don’t wanna talk about it.
I’m police investigator Henry Lando.
I’d like to ask you a few questions about the…
incident last night.
Which one?
You told the police that you were chased by a woman.
I don’t wanna talk to you.
Excuse me?
Um… excuse me.
There’s another guest waiting.
I think there’s something wrong with my air conditioning.
Could you come see me when you’re done?
Fine.
I’m checking out.
Oh.

You didn’t charge me.
Don’t I have to pay for the room?

And what makes you think you can take charge of the rest?

I would stay home until my body was done

I wouldn’t want to get hurt even more.

Apology accepted.
Luis.
What are you doing?
I’m getting my stuff.
What? You aren’t going to sleep in the bed?
I mean, they said we can…
I can’t sleep here again, Gretchen. I’ve got work to do.
Beth has been watching Alma while I’ve been here looking after you.
I have to go home and give her a break.
Please don’t leave.
You’ll be fine. There are people in here all the time.
No, there’s not! It’s deserted all night!
It’s fine. You’ll be home soon.
What if she comes back?
Gretchen, stop it!
But why? I’m not making this up!
I don’t want to hear any more about this shit.
You’re making it very difficult for your sister.
I wasn’t high.
Oh, you were!
You were tested.
You stole money from Herr König
and then you ran away with a complete stranger.
I can’t force you to do anything.
You are almost eighteen years old.
But you don’t have a job anymore
and you will not be getting an allowance.
If you wanna run away,
you take your fucking bicycle.

She’s wanted for murder.
And I expect her to come for you again.
I can protect you.
If we find her…
I personally take you wherever you want to go.
[DR. BONOMO] Does Alma listen to music often?
[BETH] She loves music,
especially since Gretchen moved in with us.
[HENRY] Now…
And this is extremely important.
Nobody must know about this investigation.
I don’t know who to trust.
[DR. BONOMO] Loud music has showed to trigger seizures
in people with Alma’s condition.
[BETH] Alma? Dr. Bonomo says music, no more.
[GRETCHEN] It’s just music.
[LUIS] You going out?
[SIGN LANGUAGE] That’s very cool.
[BETH, SIGN LANGUAGE] No, it’s not.

A month ago, a married couple on vacation
had rented this cabin.
A cabin not far from here.
The husband told the police that in the evening
he lost consciousness.
When he woke up…
he found a strange, blonde woman in his bedroom.
Along with his wife, who he found unconscious.
The blonde woman’s voice had a hypnotic effect on the man.
He chased the woman into the woods, but she got away.
When the husband returned to the cabin,
his wife had choked on her vomit.
Jesus.
Dude…
The other night, a half-naked woman came into the reception,
and she wasn’t responding to anything.
Where was she staying?
[GRETCHEN] The Lover’s Nest.
[HENRY] You’re right. The next bungalow is not in use.
[GRETCHEN] I didn’t know stakeouts were gonna be so boring.

[GRETCHEN] The resort.
What were you doing there?
I was with Trixie.
Huh.
I didn’t know Beatrix was working late last night.
She wasn’t.
She was really confused.
Come to think of it, a lot like the guest
we spoke about over the phone the other night.
Hm. I will look into this.
Why is there nobody working the reception after ten?
Seems like a lot of people need assistance after ten.
It doesn’t make sense economically.
That’s stupid, it’s a hotel.
[LUIS] Gretchen!
I can show you the numbers if you’d like. It’s not so interesting, but…
Maybe another time.
It’s quite the place you got here.
Gretchen, what’s the matter?
Why did you bring us here?
Your parents are planning a…
A new resort, I know.
Why do we have to live here?
[LUIS] Gretchen!
Because it’s pretty outside?
Calm down right now.
[RECORDER NOTES]
You are here because your family belongs here.
That’s a fucking weird way to put it!
Gretchen, that’s enough! What has gotten into you?
I don’t know dad!
I’m just reflecting on this very fucking weird living situation
that everybody just seems to be cool with.
Out!
Now!
Great.
[MR. KÖNIG] No, no, Luis.

You need some family time, I understand.
[BETH] No, Herr König, we don’t want you to leave.
It’s okay, thank you for the wonderful afternoon
and I wish you a good evening.
[LUIS] I’m very sorry.
[MR. KÖNIG] No, Luis, we are so very happy to have you here.
We’ve been desperately eager for you to be here.
And Gretchen, if there is anything that… bothers you,
don’t be afraid to…
talk to me.
Oh, I leave your package just here.
Oh… it was a surprise.
I was not supposed to say anything.
I am so sorry.
What package?
What package?
It has your family name on it.
[LUIS] It was your mother’s stuff.
The small stuff, at least.
I received it this morning.
I… your father should perhaps change the address on the counter…
What is it doing here, dad?
I sold the old house.
It was… still my house.
And I put the money in an account for you.
I… I didn’t want you to get worked up again…

Hello Ms. Vanderkurt, my name is Alma.
I’m calling you because of my sister, Gretchen.
Gretchen calls you when she feels bad,
but you never answer.
I can hear her from my room.
I’m worried.
If you get my message, I want you to call Gretchen back on the phone.
You can tell her that you love her.
It would mean a lot to her.
It would make her happy.
If you’d like to, you can come visit us.
You are always welcome here.
[TAPE CLICKS]
[MR. KÖNIG] Good, you’re packed.
Do you even know how to drive?
Where is everybody?
They’re at the hospital with Dr. Bonomo.
Alma had a very strong seizure.
It’s your fault, Gretchen. You know that.
You terrified her.
I want you now to write a farewell note.
Then we will pick up some money for you at my house
and I’ll drive you to the station.
The last train leaves in one hour.
Bring your bike.
You like it?
Sure.
You know it? A common cuckoo.

I want you to understand who you got involved with.
Herr Lando here was trespassing on my property
with an illegal firearm.
[GRETCHEN] What are you doing?
He’s a cop.
No, he’s not.
Not anymore.
You see, Erik here…
he’s actually a policeman.
He has access to police files.
Herr Lando was recently discharged
when they found out he was investigating a case,
one that he is personally involved with.
Okay, Erik. I think it’s time to take Herr Lando to the police station.
Gretchen, let’s get your money.
This way, please.
Come along, now.

[BETH SOBS]
[IN GERMAN] It is always something of a confirmation of my dreams

Gretchen, your parents need to hurry up with those construction plans.
This one needs her own mating grounds soon, no?
And you know what else she needs, Erik?
What happened to Herr Lando’s wife must not repeat itself.
I’m very sorry for what happened to your wife, Herr Lando.
But this one’s mother wandered off my area of authority.
She got nervous when this one left the nest
before we had another offspring
ready to replace her.
There were family matters prolonging my endeavor.
Actually…
Are you aware that you have had the good fortune
to witness three laying ceremonies as of now?
Wow.
Most people don’t get to attend a single one.
And those that do don’t remember that they did.
A sacred process that keeps an ancient creature alive and well.
A magnificent creature whose approach to family
is beyond human comprehension.
Which brings me back to you, Erik.
You will get Beatrix ready to conceive.
Consider your mishap last night a dry run.
[MUFFLED GUNSHOTS]
Erik?
[IN GERMAN] I told him, not in the house.
[GUNSHOT]
Shh…
Oh.
[IN GERMAN] Stay here.
No, no, no, no.

I don’t feel so good.
[DR. BONOMO] Take this.
[DR. BONOMO, IN GERMAN] Everything’s fine.

[HENRY] I think they impregnate women at the resort.
After my mom died,
I accidentally called our house…
and I heard her voice on the answering machine.
It kind of helped,
so I kept calling.
Maybe you can do that too.
[CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS]
Do you know what this bird is famous for?
This bird lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species
and then lets those birds raise its offspring.
No! Not in here!

[TENSE MUSIC]
Your parents spent their honeymoon here?
How old is your sister?
[PHONE VIBRATES]
Gretchen?
Yes, I am fine.
We are in the treatment center by the hospital.
If you come back in the morning, Alma won’t even know you were gone.
[LUIS] Alma is going to stay here for the evening.
Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor her sleep.
[GRETCHEN] Dad?
Beth and I are coming home.
Dad, I really need to talk to you about…
What is it, Gretchen?
We can’t trust them.
Gretchen, we can talk when we’re home.
[HENRY] I told you I will protect you.
Get ready.
What’s wrong with Beth?
[DR. BONOMO] Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.
This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.
Astonishing resemblance to her surrogate mother, Beth.
The surrogate mother’s distress grows in close proximity
to the biological mother.
Thus both host parents have been removed from the premises.
Compared to animal brood parasites,
homo-cuculidae developed a unique evolutionary trait.
Instead of leaving their offspring in the care of a host,
homo-cuculidae returns to claim their young.
Contact with the biological mother
speeds up the process of the offspring’s physical development
and its abilities significantly.
We are about to initiate the first close-distance encounter
with the biological mother.
[MACHINES BEEPING]
Brood parasites.
They don’t impregnate.
They implant eggs.
My wife and I tried to get pregnant.
I was supposed to fertilize that egg.
Like your father…
on his honeymoon.
[GRETCHEN] And then what do they do?
Release them into the wild.
When the mother shows up…
I end this experiment.
What about my sister?
That is not your sister.
[MR. KÖNIG] Two.
Yeah, the sister of the young woman and a rogue police detective.
Yeah, I am afraid we must commence definitive measures immediately.
She’s dead.

Joe, you hear that?
No. Hear what?
I thought Big Red wasn’t scared of anything.
You getting the heebie-jeebies, friend?
I am the heebie-jeebies.
Remind me why Junior G-man’s coming along for a ride?
I’m just here to make sure that whatever’s in that box and one pretty lady make another 600 miles to Fairfield without any trouble.
[radio chatter]
So what’s in the box?
Should I tell him?
A funnel-web spider.




Probably the most deadly arachnid in the world.
Only this one seems to house a plausibly demonic entity.
You’re yanking my chain, right?
That’s not the half of it.
There’s all manner of bizarre phenomena associated with this creature.
Temporal, gravitational
I mean things you wouldn’t believe.
I barely believe it and I’ve cataloged the photographic evidence in detail.
It’s been kept sedated in a state of sensory deprivation until we can analyze it in a more controlled setting.
Dammit, you’re not hearing that?
Hellboy, are you okay?
[boxes fall]
What’s happening?
[grunts]
Oh my god!

You alright?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, lay dead a sec.
[high pitch sinister score]
Ah! Oh fuck!
Oh shit.
[grunts]
Hellboy, Hellboy, look.
I like them better small.
Don’t let him get away. Don’t let him get away.
It’s…
[grunts]
Oh crap.
Who builds a tunnel to hell in the middle of the woods?
Some kind of ventilation shaft.
Coal mining country.
Appalachia.
Well that’s just swell, we lost the cargo.
After you.
[scoffs]
Come on…
[radio static]
He, he, he.
[sinister score]
Joe?




I’m okay.
Field work, huh?
It’s not much like research, is it?
I just don’t get it.
Spider what made it go crazy like that?
Something in these hills.
Trees, and the dirt.
Something haunted.
Evil.
This place has the stink.
I smell pine needles?
Underneath that, Joe.
Madness.
Death, called out to Daddy Longlegs.
Woke him up.
How do you know that?
Dark things call to dark things.
[blows on cigar]
I heard it too.
We are so screwed.
Screwed, chewed, and tattooed.
We need, we need to find a phone. We need to call this in.
Yeah.
Ma?
Around these parts I’m not sure which one of us stands out more.




It’s the devil come up the road.
No it ain’t.
Get!
It’s that red fella from the United Nations.
I’ve seen him once on the cover of Life magazine.
United Nations?
Look at you…
little oriental doll.
Ain’t you a purdy thing.
Um
I’m Special Agent Song, ma’am.
We’ve been in an accident; do you happen to have a phone?
Sure we do.
It’s in back next to the color television and the chicken that shits out silver dollars… and the Mercedes Benz.
Alright.
May as well come inside.
Ma’am, get these on some modern rags, doll, they’re all cut up and bloody.
Oh no, that’s not necessary.
What happened to him?
He ain’t moved a muscle since I found him.
Anyone thought of taking him to the doctor?
You guys have doctors, right?
Or you like him as a rug?
Truck’s out.
Anyhow ain’t no doctor gonna do him no good.
Why’s that?
Cause he witched, that’s why.
Witched?
Child didn’t have no sense.
Kept teasing that Cora Fisher.
Throwing rocks at her window, leaving dead things for her to find.
Told him he better stay away from her. Everyone knows Cora Fisher be a witch.
You said Cora Fisher?
Tom Ferrell. I will be damned.
I ain’t dead yet.
Never thought we’d see you around these parts again.
How many years it been, Tom?
A spell, I reckon.
I found this in the doorstep.
Hmm.
Let’s see it.
Ahh.
Yeah.
Witch ball.
Yeah, I’ve I heard of these.
That’s what made that mark there, ma’am.
You said Cora Fisher did this?
Why, you know her?
Used to.
She wasn’t a witch back then.




Take off that boy’s clothes and boil them, calling it out Cora Fisher’s name.
If she’s one that witched him, that’ll bust the spell.
You going up there, ain’t ya?
Yeah, reckon I will.
First I’m going to stop by and see my mama.
Sorry, Tom.
Figured you knew.
She’s, uh…
she’s dead?
Long time now.
Her brother come up to fetch her. Took her back East.
Oh, ain’t that, uh… what about my daddy, then?
Never did see much of him.
Not once since you left.
Guess he finally drunk himself to death.
He weren’t ever much good.
Well, friends, ma’am, I’ll be on my way.
Just a second, Mr. Ferrell.
Um, was it?
It’s Tom.
Tom, this witch, Cora
you might say, eh
this sort of thing falls under our sphere of expertise.
Do you mind if we come along?
Excuse us. Tom.
Hey. What are you doing?
Field work.
Field work?
You’re lucky to be alive.
I’m taking you back to headquarters, where you belong, in the library, spilling coffee on your weird old books.
There’s something going on here.
You said it yourself.
[grunts]
‘This place has the stink.’
Yeah, it does.
It’s exactly why you shouldn’t be here.
Look, I… I need to understand it.
Okay? And not from some weird old book, but for real.
Like you do.
Besides, are you really in such a hurry to tell Broom we lost the cargo?
If y’all are coming along you best come along.

Who’s that there?




[indistinct chatter]
Oh,
look at you
all pie-eyed.
What you come see Grammy Oakum for?
[kraa]
[kraa]
Huh?
What’s that?
[clacking]
Oh, they want to know how to make a witch ball.
Well, I’ll tell you.
It’s easy peasy, you dance around, buck naked calling out: blood of weasel, tail a rat, guts and bladder of a black cat, buzzard eggs and baby’s nails, foot of toad frog, brain of bat.
And you put a pot to boil and it all goes in.
Cut some hairs from your head and your nethers, and wrap ’em round a gob of stuff from the pot.
Make ’em round and a good size for throwing and that’s that.
You people wanna trade your souls for some balls of poison.
Grammy Oakum says: ‘Go right at it.’
[kraa]
And she’ll see you
in hell.
[caw, caw]
Magazine said they found you in a church in England.
So they tell me.
That’s all right.
Everybody knows the devil can’t set foot in no church.
You know I’m not actually, uh
The devil?
Yeah.
Oh, no, I met that son of a bitch.
He don’t look nothing like you.
Here’s Cora’s place.
Cora!
It’s Tom!
Tom Ferrell!
[sinister score]
Cora?
Cora?
You knew this girl pretty well, huh?
Well… we, uh, we weren’t much more than kids.
We were sweethearts.
Figured we’d always be together.
It’s a long time ago, I guess.
Oh, girl what you do?
Great. Fucking witch balls.
There’s more.
Eh, guys?
What do you make of this?
She must be out roaming around.
Just gotta wait for her to get back.
[buzzing]
That’ll be her demon familiar, I suspect.
I hate those.
They feed on the witch they’re attached to.
They feed off each other.
The witch, the animal.
According to the lore, they function as symbiotic parasites.
The lore.
Lord, have mercy.
[scoffs]
My mother was a witch.
I bet they left that little detail out of your magazine, huh, Tom?
Hmm?
I never met my mother.
Never wanted to.
In fact… everything I ever knew about witches I wish I didn’t.
On the way up here you mentioned you saw the devil.
Some 15 years ago, about a mile from this very spot, come upon a stream, and there she was.
No, not the devil.
Close enough.
Her name was Effie Kolb.
I knew right off she was trouble.
I’m ashamed to say I forgot all about poor old Cora Fisher after that.
You see, Effie, she was a witch, and she got me all twisted up, thinking maybe I ought to be a witch, too.
And all that talk about having power over other folks, made it sound real good.
Yeah.
So, I went out and I got me a dead black cat.
While my Ma was out, I boiled it on the stovetop till it went all to pieces.
Took that mess down to the creek, to clean off the bones.
Now Effie told me whatever bone I was holding when the devil showed up that was gonna be my lucky bone.
So arbitrary.
I knew him right off.
I heard tales about him all my life.
Mister Onselm, some of the old folks called him.
Most just called him the Crooked Man.
Crooked Man. Uhh.
As story goes, Mr. Onselm was one of the first white men who came here from Europe hundreds of years ago.
He played both sides in the war between the states.
He came to be a very rich man.
Sounds like a real clever little fella.
How did that work out for him?
They say heaven don’t have much room for rich folks.
They got plenty down there.
They sent him back up,
to claim souls instead of legal tender.
They say he takes a
a copper penny
for every soul he claims for the devil.
He gets enough of them, one day he’ll be rich again.
One look at old Mr. Onselm scared all them witchy thoughts right out of me.
Got lit off for home, swearing the whole way to be good again.
I even took that lucky bone, threw it as far as I could.
Somehow I never could be rid of it.
I was so scared when I got home, I just kept right on running.
Guess that’s how I wound up in the army.
[screams]
I come through it,
without a scratch.
It ain’t because I was born lucky,
smart,
tough…
quite the opposite.
It’s got power in it.
Just like that old witch said:
It’s got the power to hurt people.
But I never used it.
Not once.
Like I said, I never wished harm on anybody my entire life.
But not even them boys over there trying their damndest to put holes in me.
You think that means I ain’t really a witch?
[clanking of wood and glass]
You hear something?
[animal sounds]
[chokes]
[gasps]
Ahh!
No.
Ahh!
Ahh! Ma!
Cora.
[heavy panting]
[cries]
I’m sorry, Cora.
You can’t see me like this, Tom.
Shh, shh.
You just can’t.
Hey, it’s alright.
Hey, Cora, it’s alright.
Shh, Shh.
[cries]
Enjoying that field work, Joe?
How do you get used to this?
I’m gonna get you by the fire.
Why you done it, Cora? Huh?
I know I was a shit for brains kid back then,
but you was the smart one.
After you left, I didn’t know what to do.
I had to go up with Nate Southby.
We married, but he died.
Our babies died.
I was all alone, Tom.
It’s alright. You just gotta rest now, okay?
You just gotta rest.
They’re coming for me.
They’re out there, Tom. They want my soul, and they gonna have it.
Not while I’m here. Not while I’m here.
Hey, Shh, shh, shh, shh.
She out there!
She out…
Shh, shh.
[cries]
[clacking sound]
Looks like Deadsville to me.
[horse neighs]
Ohh.
[sinister score]
[gasps]
Hey, you’re alright.
Who’s this now?
This ain’t who I come to see.
Well, don’t I just like the look of you.
She never did have much use for going to church clothes.
There’s my Tommy.
She don’t look a day older than the last time I saw her.
The only way to tell how old a witch is,
you gotta cut her leg off and count the rings.
You come back to see me, Tommy?
Hell no, I ain’t.
You know who I came to see.
Not that pitiful thing Cora Fisher I hope.
Why, she ain’t even much worth tormenting, but I do it all the same.
[cries]
How’s a girl expected to pass the time?
I don’t know what you ever saw in that tragic little creature, Tommy.
Why she barely got any soul to steal.
You keep her name out of your mouth, you wicked old whore!
[giggles]
I’m just playing.
You ‘member how I like to play, Tom?
Don’t you?
I know why you’re here.
And he knows it, too.
He got,
let’s just call it
un-finished business with you.
I know.
I aim to finish it.
[laughs]
Ahh!
Jesus
Hey!
Still a wild hare with more spunk than sense, ain’t ya?
Hey that’s enough of that.
You tell your master if he wants to get to these poor folks,
he’s gonna have to go through me.
You? Ha. Mister
he ain’t a tiny bit afraid of you.
And Tommy,
I near forgot.
He asked me to give you a present.
No!
‘fraid he don’t look like much.
I’ve been riding him pretty hard every night since you left.
Guess he pretty near wore out.
Curse you, Effie Kolb!
Curse you!
This can’t be real.
Radioactive, man.
Oh,
Oh, no.
No.
[horse whinnies]
What’d they do to you, Daddy? What?
[wheezing]
Daddy. Shh, shh, shh. Hey.
Tommy.
That’s you, boy?
You, you come home.
You.
Come…
I’m sorry, Daddy. I…
Cora?
Is Reverend Watts still in that little church up on the side of the mountain?
He is, but you can’t go up there, Tom.
You heard Effie Kolb,
Crooked Man’s waiting on ya.
Maybe he is…
Maybe that’s why I came back.
Thought I’d have it out with that old devil.
Not before I get this sinner buried in church ground.
[buzzing]
Oh, my God, Cora!
Oh!
[buzzing]
[heavy panting]
[gasp]
Oh.
You didn’t want me to squash?
No,
squashing’s good.
Totally approve of that.

Oh, it’s my sins that done it. He’s my burden to carry.
Think of it a little different,
I think sins are just a part of who we are.
We’re born with them and we’ll die with them.
You mean like a Adam and Eve kind of sin?
I mean sins you can’t shake.
Saw ’em off,
and they just grow back.
I’m speaking metaphorically, of course.
Friendly folks around here.
Salt of the damn earth.
Maybe you can help me with something, Cora.
I’ll try.
I’ve been studying spells.
What makes them tick?
It’s more than just the words, right? I mean,
an incantation on its own does nothing.
Well, in my case, I sold my mortal soul off to the Devil.
So that probably helps grease the wheels some.
Right.
Besides that?
Needs to touch your heart.
When I do a hex,
I think of the saddest thing I can.
That seems to make the magic come on stronger.
Ain’t none of my business,
ma’am,
have you been trying to do witch magic?
It’s just research.
You want to be real careful with that.

Everybody knows the devil can’t set foot in no church.
What the hell is this place?
I think you know.
It’s your mama, ain’t it?
That’s news to me. I’ve never seen her face.
Yeah, I guess that’s her.
She tried to get out of paying for all them sins.
Now she’ll have no rest from tormenting.
She ain’t slept a wink for more days than I know how to count.
[gasps]
Sins?
They couldn’t have been that bad,
right?
They were many. Consorted with demons,
flew upon the black goat and gave herself for the Sabbat,
changed her shape into that of varmints,
and things unnameable.
[wings flap]
He’s here.
Wow.
That’s a big fucking bird.
Beast takes many forms,
this be but one.
Sweet

What the fuck?
Please.

If you will forgive me, let me go up to God.
To God?
No. This is where you belong.
My Lord.
My master.
What more can I give thee?
So much more.
Can you not feel the new life growing inside you?
It can’t be possible?
A dark thing.
Malignant.
It can’t be for I am dead.
You sang out to the deep of night,
and the night things answered.
Now you will give the world a gift.
A gift.
A son.
[screams]
A beautiful son.
Ow.
Woah, easy there, easy.
I’m fine.
Oh shit, my head feels like Minnie Minoso took a swing at it.
Ahh.
He brought you back.
Cora. Cora!
Cora!
Cora.
[gasps]
I used it.
I used the lucky bone.
If I wasn’t a witch before…
I surely am now.
[somber score]
There you go, Daddy.
It’s consecrated ground.
Let’s get you inside, you old sinner.
Reverend.
That you? Tom Ferrell?
How’d you know, Reverend?
She told me.
She?
There’s a girl here.
Come in a couple of minutes before you fellas. Bold as brass.
You don’t see her?
Well,
maybe she a ghost.
Is it Cora Fisher?
Cora Fisher?
Yep.
Remember her when she was just a little tadpole.
Devil might have got a body,
but he didn’t get her soul.
It’s y’daddy, ain’t it?
Figured he ought to be buried in proper church ground.
So he shall.
All right, Daddy.
But I think you got another purpose for being up here on the Hurricane, don’t you?
Yes, sir.
We, uh,
we aim to go up that hill.
You’re going to his house?
Now, why would any damn fool want to do a thing like that for?
My daddy’s dead.
Cora
You’re dead.
I’m sorry, girl.
Maybe all that’s left to do is surrender myself to him.
Tell him, take my body,
take my soul,
take your goddamn penny.
Just so long as there’s no more killing on my conscience.
After all, a deal’s a deal, ain’t it?
That’s ridiculous.
You were just a kid. A deal with a demonic entity?
How can that possibly be binding?
Oh, it be binding.
Hellboy.
Yeah, it’s kind of binding.
Look, there may be some wiggle room.
It’s what I’m here for.
To renegotiate.
Negotiate, my ass.
Well, he do seem like a pretty persuasive fella, Reverend, don’t he?
Men’s pride and folly, all that is.
Well, if you’re gonna go, best do it when the sun’s up in the sky.
His power’s strongest when it’s dark.
Y’all stay here tonight.
We got to boogie-woogie, preach.
Looks like we still have some daylight left.
You sure about that?
[sinister score]
That, that’s, no, wait, that’s not possible.
no, the Earth, the Earth doesn’t spin. It, it, that’s not how it works.
[laughs]
We on his time up in the Hurricane.
[clacking]
[psychotic echoing chants]
We’ve got company.
A lot of witches around these parts.
Always have been.
Used to be plenty of regular folks, too.
Nowadays, mostly just witches.
Haha! Hallelujah.
And I will lead the blind by a way they know not.
And I will make the darkness light for them.
And the crooked things straight.
Oneiros und Nótt
SchlieBßen Sie ihre Augen
[whispers]
Needs to touch your heart.
When I do a hex.
I think of the saddest thing I can.
Let not your hearts be troubled.
Them witches. Can’t set foot on this holy ground.
And that black magic.
Ain’t no good here.
I guess we’ll find out soon enough.
You doubt the power of prayers, son?
I just like to have some excessively high-caliber ammo on hand.
Just in case.
Oh! Sheee. Ha!
Tommy…
Shhh!
Tommy…
I know you can hear me in there.
Ain’t you had enough trouble for one day?
[moan] It ain’t even really begun.
All your friends in that church with you,
they all gonna die.
All on your account.
That’s why you gotta come out and face him.
[giggles]
[knock]
[knock]
[knock]
[screeching]
Elvis’s ass don’t shake this hard.
Reverend, the coal mines, do they run under this church?
Oh, they run everywhere.
A coal mine collapsed about 30 years ago. Last time the ground shook like this.
100 men killed.
Buried alive.
Great place to build a church, huh, Joe?
Where’s Tom?
[laughs]
I don’t see what’s so godforsaken funny.
[clacking]
[chants]
[hellish whispers]
Little Tom Ferrell, come back to see me.
Bring me my lucky bone.
I come to collect it, Tom Ferrell.
Yeah and I’m gonna give it to you.
You gotta make me one promise.
No harm comes to those good folks in there.
But it was you who put them in harms way,
not I.
All right, then.
All right.
[chants]
I don’t think so.
See, I don’t like this deal.
You want it too bad,
and that makes me not want you to have it.
Go on inside, Tom.
Go.
Well, ain’t you a pug-ugly son of a bitch?
Pot calling the kettle black here, but
Jesus H.
[chants]
Oh, yeah, that’s right.
The nympho-broad in the tree mentioned you weren’t afraid of me.
Well guess what? I’m not afraid of you either.
So why don’t you turn around,
take your crooked ass out of here, and take those dizzy bitches with you.
You had a different aspect
when you watched your mother burn.
What the hell you say, Gumby?
Be gone from this church, Mr. Onselm. You be gone now.
You saw how she is.
This sorrowful thing.
She suffers so.
But I have it in my power to mollify her pain.
Let her feathered soul take wing.
Really?
You would do that?
Yeah.
Something small in return is all I ask.
That you twist off the head of that little Tom Ferrell.
and bring it hither.
We’re just
renegotiating.
I’m sure we can see eye to eye.
Why?
You got witch blood in you, friend.
You’re more like me
than you are like them.
Come on, snake, let’s rattle.
[buzzing]
[buzzing intensifies]
Ohh!
[laughs]
Help him.
Oh, come on!
Oh! He’s kilt. He’s kilt for sure.
Arg! I ain’t kilt.
You can’t hide in there forever, Tommy.
Crooked Man gonna wear you out, boy.
Oh, you shut your cursed mouth.
He gonna heap sorrows on you a hundred times worse than what you drunken
daddy ever got.
You get out of my skull, you witch! Witch! Get out of my skull!
Ahh!
Joe,
I need you.
Reverend.
Now we both know, Reverend, a deal’s a deal.
Here’s what I’ll do.
I’ll buy that lucky bone from you.
Ain’t nothing in here for sale to you, Mr. Onselm.
Do it.
Okay.
Urmm! Ahh!
Come on, Joe, you gotta pull harder.
Come on!
Ahh!
Uhh, I know you got no use for legal tender, old man.
But what about time?
What do you give for
ten years of it?
What are you doing to me, Satan?
How about
twenty?
Fix up those
eyes of yours while we’re at it.
Come on!
No, sir! I come fairly by my years and my afflictions,
and I don’t want nothing else.
[clacking]
Abby Riley done poisoned two husbands. How’d she get planted in a church yard?
So many sinners in this consecrated ground.
[chants]
Flesh rots, but the sin goes on.
[chants]
Oh shit.
Okay, are you sure you’re okay? Because…
You want to stick your finger in?
No I do not.
You can’t keep bleeding like this
I’ll be fine.
No, no, you will not be fine
Bobbie Jo.
Part of the job.
Okay? I can’t wait to get my hands on that Howdy Doody fuck.
Where the hits just keep on coming.
He looks a little different, doesn’t he?
Mm-hmm.
You always did like them pretty girls, didn’t you, Reverend?
I could feel your eyes on me giving them Sunday sermons.
You go lay back down, Abigail. This ain’t your world no more.
Kiss me, Father.
Kiss me like you always wanted to.
Kiss this.
[chants]
What are you doing?
Callie Hicks, fornicator.
Fornicator!
Abel Jacobs.
Gambler.
Josie Ward.
Philanderer.
Manly Langrishe.
Lying drunk.
Lying drunk!
Nathan Green.
Murderer.
Like ducks at the county fair.
Flora Sue Baker.
Cheatin’ whore.
Cheatin’ whore.
Ada Calder.
Child killer.
[indistinct chants and hysterical laughter]
They were dead, and buried.
Sins were forgiven.
Forgiven don’t mean forgotten.
Wyatt Ferrell.
Drunken old fool.
Ha ha ha.
Agsk
Ugh!
What is this?
No, wait, wait.
Fuck.
Sorry Daddy.
Lord, I can’t look on this no more.
Take my eyes away.
And I don’t want no gifts from the devil.
Thank you, Lord.
Tom Ferrell!
Give me that old cat bone!
I was never gonna use it, Reverend.
You watch now. I ain’t no perfect man.
None of us is.
I got a shadow in my heart like anyone else.
But you gonna see that light, Tom Ferrell.
You gonna let it blaze bright inside of you.
Just like that light be blazing in me.
I’m all fired up.
I’m gonna bust that evil wide open.
I’m gonna squeeze it.
I’m gonna squeeze the Holy Spirit
into this vile unlucky bone!
I can feel it.
Look at it blaze, Tom Ferrell.
Look at it!
Every grave in this yards
been dug with this shovel.
If it ain’t full of God
then nothing is.
Thy rod and thy staff!
They comfort me.
That’ll work.
Yep.
[coughs]
[clacking]
[caw]
He’s going home.
Ah-ah. Hellboy, no.
We call this in and come back with the whole team from the bureau.
Better to finish this. He’s hurt.
He’s weak.
Joe, you’re done.
Staying back here with the Reverend.
No.
We don’t come back,
you keep going down that mountain and you don’t stop until you find a telephone.
Don’t ever come back here.
What?
Keep the shovel.
[song: ‘Enchanted Sea’ by The Bentleys]
It’s been called that since I can remember.
A long time back a hurricane blew down a mess of trees on this mountain.
They never grew back.
No one still alive remembers it.
Might have been a thousand years ago for all I know.
And hell, maybe it wasn’t no hurricane at all.
How’s that?
Well,
the Indians say it’s always been bad.
They say there’s ghosts and critters up here older than the flood.
Scarce animals. Shonokins. Mountain spirits.
Here me out,
I might be just talking out of my ass here, but
might be looking at a dimensional rifting.
Lovecraft type scenario.
The old gods forcing their way into our world type thing.
I don’t know nothing about that, but
it’s a queer, bad feeling place, that’s for sure.
Gonna need a new shovel.
Something in these hills.
Something haunted.
Evil.
In the trees.
In the dirt.
Tom said these hills were like a living thing.
Come again?
He said the old mines were like its circulatory system.
Its veins running underground.
The Crooked Man, I think,
I think he draws power from it.
You got something on your mind, girl?
Something I don’t like.
Maybe if we disrupt the power source, we can hurt him.
What?
I’m talking about sabotage.
If this were a war and those tunnels were supply lines, we’d plant dynamite.
You gonna dynamite that mine?
No.
Maybe something better.
A spell.
Girl,
You outta your mother fucking mind.
I didn’t know if it was real,
or if it was just a story they tell little chaps to scare them.
You ready?
They told me them stories too.
Could use a woman’s touch.
[kraa]
They go down into them mines.
Make me understand
why they built a church
on top of a very convenient access
to a collapsed coal mine?
Explain it to me like I’m a little…
a little slow.
Wha-
S’ppose they thought
it was some kind of doorway
‘tween this world and the other.
They reckon they’d drop a church on top.
Consecrate the soil.
Block the doorway.
Maybe not such a swell idea.
Worked all right up until today.
It’s dark down there.
Dark as the devil’s asshole.
If we’re going…
I’m bringing this along.
Maybe it got a bit of holy left in it.
We?
No, Reverend, I…
Down there,
I ain’t much more blind than you is, girl.
[baby cries]
[baby screams]
I always figured rich folks had them some real fine soirees.
Mm-hmm.
Real fine.
All right.
[baby whimpers]
Tom!
Bet you wishing your friend was here.
Yeah, he’s not afraid of anything.
Oh, I know somethin’ afraid of:
he afraid to tell you how he really feels about you.
Tom?
Tom.
Ahh!
Something’s coming.
[laughter]
Ahh!
Run, girl!
Hurry up! This way, this way!
And he shall eat the flesh of your sons,
and the flesh of your daughters
shall he eat.
Destroy them in wrath.
Destroy them
that they may be no more.
Magic ain’t like a bullet, girl.
You just can’t pull the trigger.
Some things you can’t understand by thinking.
It comes from the spirits, not the meat!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Oh, crap.
Ahh!
[baby toy sounds]
When’s the last time you felt the touch of a woman, Tommy?
Have all these years been so lonesome?
Did you sit up and dream about me?
I know it, I bet you never stopped thinking about the way I touched you.
You got something hard for me, Tommy?
Yeah, I do.
Ahh!
[gasps]
I know well thou are my son.
Thine eyes,
thine eyes attest to it.
Let’s not pretend this is some beautiful moment.
I don’t care about you.
You never gave a damn about me.
Thou should look upon me and say these things?
I should let you burn!
I gotta get you out of here.
No, my sweet child.
I can’t be saved.
This burning be my fate.
For them many sins I done,
all us witches end up the same.
[panting]
[clacking]
[panting]
There’s only one way to end this pain.
Destroy me, my son.
No.
No, I can’t do that.
You can’t ask me to do that.
For thy scorn.
For thy wrath.
Thou were right to hate me.
I hated myself!
Myself!
This goddam monster you made!
Oneiros und Nótt, beruührt die Gedanken meiner Feinde.
SchlieBßen Sie ihre Augen und fangen sie bis zum naächsten
Sonnenaufgang in Traäaumen ein. Oneiros und Nótt, beruührt die Gedanken
chlieBßen Sie ihre Augen und fangen sie bis zum naächsten

Forgotten,
Dust without meaning.

There’s gotta be another way.
There is none.

SchlieBßen Sie ihre Augen und fangen sie bis zum naächsten
Sonnenaufgang in Traäaumen ein.
This agony, I can’t bare it any longer.
Please!
No!
Ahh!!
Ahh!!
You alright, big fella?
Some kind of booby trap.
A spell.
I almost…
something broke it.
[crows]
[clacking]
It smells like death,
and bird shit.
Wait here.
[demonic sounds]
[growl]
Oh crap.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
Please, please, fuck!
[loud thump]
[breaking glass]
[demonic squeal]
Ahhh!
Gah! Ahh!
Ugh.
Egh! Guh!
Oh! Ahh!
Uah!
[scream]
[buzzing]
Better you’d given me that boy’s head when you had the offer.
That’s twice you might have saved your fork-tongued mother.
Well, but you’ll be by her side soon enough,
suckling that black teat in hell.
You must die in this house to feed the earth beneath,
to feed these hills,
these ancient stones that do live.
Hey there, devil,
I got something for you.
That’s for Cora Fisher.
You go on and choke on it, son of a bitch.
[vomiting sounds]
[coins falling on the floor]
Look at this devil, fools himself into thinking he’s a man.
Your road ends in the dark like mine.
And this, witch,
No I ain’t.
You’ll burn, both of ya.
Like Cora Fisher burns.
Like your witch mother burns.
That’s all for you.
[gun shot]
It’s all souls, ain’t it?
[coins drop]
Look at it.
You think that one’s mine?
I don’t know.
Guess you’ll find out someday.
Like all of us.
You know what I think, Tom?
I think that so-called lucky bone of yours, I think it’s just a cat bone.
All this time you thought it held the power, but I think the power was in you.
He was afraid of you.
He was right to be.
[cries]

Get up.
You went inside the tunnels.
Unbelievable.
You’re supposed to be the smart one.
Yeah, you’re telling me.
Oh, look…
I got the cargo back.
Nice field work, right?
Besides, I wasn’t down there by myself.
I was with the Reverend the whole time.
Never would have gotten out of there without him.
[somber score]
I can’t wait for the 60s.
60s, yeah?
This ain’t my decade, Bobbie Jo.
I feel good times are coming.
I think so, too.
I ain’t gonna miss this place much.
Me neither.
Can’t wait to get home and just document all this.
That Tom Ferrell’s not a bad egg.
Lucky you came along when you did.
He just needed a little push, that’s all.
[radio]
Hey!
Not afraid of anything, are you, big guy?
Yeah, well, there’s an upside to looking like this, Joe.
You see this face in the mirror long enough the monsters don’t look too bad.
Yeah, yeah.
I know something you’re afraid of, though.
There you are.

* * *
[Jady] You ever think about trying to unfuck your life?
Yeah, maybe not.
But I have.
This is how I did it.
[lively music playing]
[chewing noisily]
Yeah.
[timer buzzing, ticking]
[bell dings]
Where the fuck are my matches?
[muffled explosion]
[boys coughing outside]
[Jady] Some families have a long line of dentists or lawyers.
We had a long line of felons.
Shit. All right.
Try it your way.
[Crabcake] Your dumb-ass twin gonna do his trick?
[laughing]
Call him that again,
I’ll kick a board up your ass!
From a stepladder, you might. [laughing]
[Jady] That is Uncle Crabcake.




The genius drowned a few years later after getting his dick stuck in a pool drain.
[Crabcake] Shit. Chair’s in the way!
[lock clicking]
[Jady] The handsome fella, that’s me.
Got it?
The big ugly one is my twin brother Moke.
Got it?
Please don’t do that, man.
It is super frustrating.
Now?
Shut…
[lock clicks]
[Jady] We were partners in crime.
I had the plans, he had the hands.
Fuck yeah.
What do they say?
Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life?
Well, I love this.
Moke? Ah, not so much.
Somebody shooting out there?
[Crabcake scoffs]
They’re working on a little baby safe,
thinking they’re gonna be some big-time juggers.
[Young Jady] Moke already peeled it.
He did not.




Thirty-eight bucks, shithead.
Tradecraft.
Good for you, son.
Where’s Mom?
[whisk tapping in bowl]
She got some work with Glenn, but she’ll be back.
Here, keep this moving, honey.
She gonna miss Thanksgiving again?
She’ll be here soon.
How’s that turkey, Mama?
[engine approaching]
[Glenn] Yeah!
[whoops] Coming in hot like Earnhardt, baby!
[engine revving]
[tires screech]
[Crabcake] What the hell?
Oh, shit! Shit.
Where the hell’s my stash at?
[Glenn whoops]
[Glenn] Hot dang, we did it, baby!
Heck yes, we did!
[whoops] I’m gonna fuck you like we’re millionaires, ’cause we are, baby.
Whoo! Hey, big guy.
Oh! There’s my handsome guys.
[Jady] That’s Mom and her boyfriend Glenn.




Glenn was cool as shit.
Oh, God. Oh, I’m bleeding out.
[Crabcake] Nana, did you smoke my ganja?
Oh, I found it! Oh, good, I found it.
[Cath] Hey, hey, come on. Don’t be scared, Moke.
You keep that gravy moving.
[all gasping]
Honey, control the weapon!
[Crabcake] Muck! Get out of the way!
Fuckin’ A.
This is my quality shit.
Get out of the way.
Can I get a plate, Gamma?
Greens?
No, ma’am, just the bird.
Mom.
[sirens wailing in distance]
Right. Um…
So…
I’m gonna miss this Thanksgiving.
I know you don’t like it. I don’t like it.
In fact, I think it fucking sucks.
But where you going?
Pretty far, I guess.
Ought to hurry, hon.




[Cath] Thanks, Mama. Come on.
[Glenn] Whoa, they got me, baby!
Baby, let’s go.
[Glenn] Oh, my plate. My plate.
Babe, forget the fucking plate.
Yeah, that looks good. Okay.
You don’t need the fucking turkey.
Let’s go.
Happy Christmas, everybody.
[Cath] We’re going a lot farther than Tijuana.
Come on.
Ah-ha, yeah, yeah.
Motherfuckin’ tequila time.
[Cath] Shit.
Jady, Moke, come here a minute.
You listening?
Now, you need to take care of him,
and you need to take care of him.
That is the whole deal now.
Okay?
[Glenn] Ándale, baby.
All right, come here.
Okay.
[Glenn] Oh, shit.
[Moke] Love you, Ma.
Okay. All right. Okay.
[Glenn moaning]
You could take us with you.
[Glenn] Oh, it’s cold.
[sirens wailing in distance]
I couldn’t use you.
[car door closes]
[engine revving]
[Glenn] Oh, no, I left my turkey on the car!
[Cath] Forget the turkey, baby.
[Jady] Our family,
not so big on education.
[boys coughing]
More of a learn-by-doing arrangement.
And me and Moke, we learned from the very best.
[Cath] Come on, eat my ass, fuckers!
[Glenn] Please go easy, baby. I’m infirm.
Hey, we got ’em. We got ’em. It’s okay.
[breathing heavily]
It’s okay. You’re not bleeding even anymore.
[Glenn] Don’t worry, honeybee. I’ll stash the goods.
[Cath] Huh?
They’re beautiful.
They’re so fucking beautiful.
Babe, what are you doing?




Oh, no, no, no!

[Jady] Now, I could’ve kept pulling jobs forever,
but when you work with family, it sometimes gets complicated.
[Moke groans]
[Jady] Relax, Moke. This is the last one.
[Moke] Last one? You’ve been saying that since we were 12.
[thunder rumbling]
Hey, look at me.
If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it.
Same as always.
Yeah, what are you gonna do if I don’t?
I don’t know, case solo jobs
or get somebody else who’s not such a wet blanket all the time.
Don’t worry about me.
I’m not worrying about you. I’m just wondering.
God, Mom would be so bummed with you right now.
What fucking mom?
Hey! Did it ever occur to you
that maybe she was doing the best she could?
Did it ever occur to you how different things could’ve been for us?
Huh?
No, it didn’t.
And I can’t believe you, with this negative shit right now right before work.
You asked me.




[mocking] “You asked me.”
[scoffs]
[mocking scoff]
Ah. Fuck.
[tense music playing]
[Jady] You got this. Tension’s right there, bro.
[Moke] Shut the fuck up.
[safe beeps]
[Jady chuckles]
[Jady] Go start the van.
[Moke] What?
Go start the van.
[Moke] “Go start the van.” What am I, valet?
[Jady wolf whistles]
Ooh.
[security guard] All right, kid.
[gun cocks]
Turn around.
Slow.
[Jady] [chuckles] Please don’t be alarmed, sir.
I’m the new custodian here.
[Moke] Excuse me, sir?
[alarm blares]
[Jady] Come on, let’s go!
[security guard groaning]
Sorry.
[Jady] Careful. Use the handrail.
It’s slick.
I’m using it!
[officer] Freeze!
Let me see them hands! Drop the bag!
[sirens approaching]
[Jady] Okay, I’ll admit it. We probably should’ve
stayed home that night, had some soup, went to bed early.
“Night, Moke. Night, Jady. Sweet dreams.”
I don’t know. Whatever normal people do.
[whispers] Oh, fuck.
[officer 2] Turn around slowly!
[Jady sighs] Aw, fuck.
[officer] Get on the ground! Onto your knees!
[Jady] You only got two options when you screw up your life.
You can say “Fuck it.”
[woman moaning over small speaker]
Or, like I said, you can unfuck it.
And that’s what I was going to do.
[buzzer blares]
[Muzzy] One for the road?
[Jady] Aw, that’s nice of you, Muzzy.
You did always have the softest lips.
But I’m late, you know?
Still want to know how you sprung for an early bounce.
Good behavior is all.
You here to walk me out, Farful?
Still “Officer Farful” until I do.
[Jady] Hey, before I forget,
could I get your dad’s address?
I really want to send him a fruit basket.
No need for that.
Courts review cases all the time.
They’re just… juggling bunks.
I really appreciate you putting a good word for me, Officer Farful.
I won’t let you down.
Would you go and make sure that Mr. Munger’s paperwork
is sorted out, please?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Seems like a nice guy. Eh.
Are you fucking with me?
[mocking] “I won’t let you down.”
You giving me a little poke-poke?
Huh?
No, I am not giving you a poke-poke.
Do not fuck with me or I will cleave your ass in half!
You’ll be back in here before you’re even off the lot.
It’s just a phone call.
I know where I stand.
Yeah.
And remember, you have some emeralds to deliver.
I’ll stay in touch.
[Moke] Don’t get me wrong, running three restaurants is great,
but I think I’m more, like, regional manager material.
I mean, I could be making, like, 125,000…
Hey, babe, you’ll get the party platter?
[Moke] I’m sorry, say what?
The party platter.
Uh, yep. And sides.
And ice, please.
Ice.
Yep.
But not the crushed kind.
My dad hates the crushed ice ’cause it melts too fast.
Copy that. Uh, cubes, not crushed.
[Abby sighs]
Cubes, cubes.
I hate that I’m nervous.
That he makes me nervous, like our house is a report card.
Abs, it’s gonna be fine. We’re gonna do this together.
[sighs] And you’ll talk to Swofford?
Yeah, Daryl got a raise after nine months.
I’ve been there a year. I’m good. I’m good.
[pop music playing quietly over speakers]
Fired?
Uh, yes. Thank you, Daryl.
Mm-hmm.
I don’t… [stammers]
We just bought a house. We’re having a kid.
I mean, in-insurance? I don’t understand. Who called?
Uh, it’s the Bureau of, uh…
it was the Labor and Employment Bureau
doing a survey on prior offenders in food service.
You… you didn’t disclose your records when you applied.
I was gonna get a party platter.
You can still do that.
You just won’t get the employee discount ’cause…
you don’t work here anymore.
Okay.
I wanted to talk to you about…
…maybe being promoted.
[lighthearted music playing]
[Jady] And I’m telling you, I thought it was “Peace Corpse,”
and I was gonna be saving dead people.

She seems great.
She is great.
Listen, um…
Back then, you know,
I ta… I talked with Freddie Unk at the legal clinic, and…
…he suggested I just stay away from the trial.
Like, don’t get near it.
Hmm.
He also say don’t visit
or don’t call? [chuckles]
I mean, you ghosted me, man.
How’d you cut your bid?
There’s a crooked screw in there named Farful. His dad’s a judge.
Let’s just say I cut a low-key deal to
vacate my conviction.
What’d you do?
Bought a score from a lifer,
pitched Farful 50% if he could tap his dad for me.
[groans]
It’s a low-key job.
Garment shop. Cash on site.
Old floor safe.
You could rip that open like wet bread.
No.
Like I said, low-key.
Look, here’s what’s up.
I’m having a housewarmingslash-baby-shower-type deal today,
and you can have barbecue or ice cream,
whatever it is you want, and then just go on your way,
and don’t ever mention this crazy shit to me again.
But our end would be low seven.
I’m not that guy anymore.
But I don’t want to do it without you.
I guess you can’t do it, then.

So, Mike’s ears were, like, so messed up as a kid,
he was basically deaf until he was about ten years old,
that he couldn’t pronounce “J.T.,” so he said “Jady.”
Like, “Jady.”
And I couldn’t say “Mike,”
so I said “Moke,” but that’s, you know, just because I’m lazy.
[chuckles]
Moke?
How have I never heard about this?
Ashamed of his past.
Oh, come on, Moke, I didn’t tell ’em about the goblin mask
and the coins and the police. [chuckles]
Really?

Trying to look impressive, and you’re embarrassing me!
[Jady] I’m so high right now.
It’s like wrestling a jelly doughnut!
[bag rustles sharply]
That was the opposite of what I need right now.
I’m sorry. I overreacted.
It’s why-why I didn’t want him to stay.
Oh, you’re going with this is my fault? That’s your strategy?
No, I just…
Jady wasn’t in the Peace Corps.
No shit, babe.
No tan, soft hands, stick and poke on his neck?
What was he locked up for?
Burglary.
And… assault.
Look, he and I, years ago…
Hey. I know.
You went over the speed limit a bit. So did I.
Neither of us were perfect, but we can be better now.
For each other.
And for Blueberry.
For Blueberry, yeah.
She does half the shit I did, she’s going to, like, military school.

[gasping]
Thank you.
So, what’s up? You don’t like your new phone?
I-I li… I like it. Huh?
So, how come it’s not on ya, huh?
Where’d you go?
Nowhere. [stammers]
Come on, Farful. I just got some grub.
Eh.
From now on, this stays with you.
And when I say, “Call me,” I want you to think of that like…
like a little doggie would when he hears me say, “Heel.”
And I don’t mean at some point. I don’t mean in the future.
What I do mean is, exactly at that moment in time, you fucking call me!
So we made a deal.
Where are my emeralds?
What’s the holdup?
Making arrangements.
But it takes time. I got to line up the talent.
Talent?
Yeah, I can’t do it all by myself.
Specialists, you know, come out of my pocket.
Ah, what the fuck is that?
Uzi! I got it online.
Two one hundredths of a Bitcoin.
Plus shipping.
It’s also a parole violation in case it comes to that.
See, my father has certain expectations.
It’s best if they’re met.
[grunts]
Oh, um, one more thing.
About those, uh, “specialists.”
You didn’t say anything to them about me, right?
Course not.
Good.
Good doggie.

Hello? Yeah, please send an ambulance at, uh, Reg…
What? Hello?
Ah, shit. Are you there?
What happened?
It was the guy I told you about.
He just came over to pay me a visit… What is your emergency?
…and had some fun on my face.
[grunting] Oh, God. Fuck.
Hello? Sir?
Calling an ambulance like I’m some old lady.
It’s embarrassing. You have 911 on the line.

[Jady cries softly]
I mean, is this guy gonna clip you, or what?
Probably, maybe, maybe not.
I don’t know. [sniffles]
I’m still paying the price for getting copped in that warehouse, huh?
Not all of us get second chances, I guess.
[groans]
Damn it.
[sniffles, groans] Where?
I don’t know. This guy, he probably lives in a tree.
No, the safe. Where is the safe?
Down in Chaplain, a day’s drive.
It’s all doped. It’s a milk run.
One day.
Tops.
Hmm.
[groans]
I mean, you know, there and back,
so, uh, two days really, with piss breaks, but yeah.
[Abby over phone] A day?
I mean, there and back, so two days.
With piss breaks, but yeah.
You have to go right now? I need your help here.
I’ll be back before no time.
[sighs] What aunt is this?
It’s, uh, great-aunt. Gamma Jean.
You know, Jady was better keeping in touch with her, so they were really tight.
And now that she’s in hospice, he just wants to see her one last time.
If this is a lie, it’s a bad one.
I… Abs, he’s got nowhere else to go for Thanksgiving.
So… [stammers] it’s either I ship him up there,
or he’s in our home telling your dad all about “shitting with a celly” etiquette.
What?
S-Set a schedule and just stick to it.
This is my first crack at real family time in years, Mike.
And my first in longer without having a sip of something.
Just be at this table.
I will.
I love you.
And Blueberry. [chuckles softly]
I love you, too.
“I love you.”
Oh, dude.
Oh, I-I love you.
Oh, I lov… Oh, I lo… I love you.

Of course you do.
But it takes the three of us.
How can I spell this out any clearer to you?
I am finished stealing shit.
It’s not stealing. It’s like reclaiming lost property.
Those emeralds are basically our birthright.
Think about your family.
Think about Blueberry.

Why don’t you just fuck already?
Geez.
[lively chatter outside]
It’s once in a lifetime, Moke.
Money. Real money. Lots of it.
All we got to do is just dig ’em up.
Then you can go back to living straight, like you’ve been, but comfortable.

But you did. So we’re gonna have to figure that out.

Okay. Well, prove it.

And then say it again.
And you just keep saying it until they swear it’s the truth.
And you skin ’em.

How does he not see that coming?
He was hungry.
You know, even though she taught me how to lie,
I thought Mom always meant to tell the truth.
Yeah, she taught me how to run.
Oh, right. It’s about that time.
Moke, go home to your family. I’ll be fine.

Not Freddie. Fuck Freddie.
Fuck Freddie.
A real lawyer.
I don’t know. Maybe we drew up the paperwork for a living trust for your kid.
Money’s all hers now.
[laughs]
Isn’t that great?
[both laughing]
Yeah.
You gave your half away?
The fuck would you give your half away?
The fuck? You gave your half away, so, you know…
No, no, because I knew you still had yours,
and I could hit you up if I needed it, seeing that I saved your ass.
Oh, okay. [scoffs]
Well, now you’re gonna have to hit up your daughter, Blueberry Munger,
as soon as she learns how to speak and sign with a crayon.
You put it under the name “Blueberry”?
Yeah, that’s her name.
No, we were being cute.
What kind of name is “Blueberry”?
Well, that’s her name if she wants two million bucks.
It’s a great name.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
They grow up quick, man.

[Moke] Oh.

Blueberry’s the full legal name, but Mike doesn’t like it.
[Moke] No. Yeah, but we decided on “Blue,” didn’t we?
[Jady] Berry.
It’s just Blue. It’s really simple.

We don’t call you “John Thomas.”

Do you want to hold her?
Absolutely.
Oh.

Genre: Animation, Adventure, Family

Director: Néstor F. Dennis

Writers: Néstor F. Dennis

Stars: Johnny Depp
Plot: Johnny Puff and his friends embark on a thrilling secret mission to save Taigasville from the evil plans of Otto von Walrus.
* * *
Welcome to TAIGASVILLE, a tiny coastal town in the Arctic where four inseparable friends live.
The PUFFINS!
These little guys can’t stay still for even a moment; they’re mischievous and playful.
They’re always looking for new adventures and one of those Adventures change their lives forever.
One day, they found a map that showed where a pirate treasure was.
The four explorers wasted no time and quickly went deep into the Arctic in search of that precious prize.
But on their journey, one of them accidentally fell into an icy cave.
Inside, they found something even more valuable than any treasure.
A meteorite that gave them incredible powers.
But let’s get to know them a little better now.
The littlest of the team is TIC.
He’s clumsy, naive, and has a good heart.
He’s able to control the forces of Nature.
PIE is the giant of the group.
She’s grouchy and impulsive.
When she transforms, she never gets tired
and becomes unstoppably strong.
TAC is the brains of the bunch.
He examines every detail very closely and is always one step ahead of everybody else.
He’s able to master control technology and calculate anything in a matter of seconds, even the times table of one.
DIDI is the most self-absorbed and vain of them all.
For her, any time is a good time to take a selfie.




Her powers are being able to break the sound barrier and to make time go slower.
And finally, there’s JOHNNY PUFF, a retired rock star.
He lives a peaceful life in harmony with Nature.
Although the others always disturb the tranquillity of his peaceful life, he likes leading his team.
Thanks to the power of music, he can transform into a sneaky ninja warrior.
Together, they are the guardians of TAIGASVILLE, united in the effort to preserve their home.
Their secret mission is to save the Arctic.
A new day is dawning.
Inside a technological fortress lives the engineer OTTO VON WALRUS, famous for his craftiness and intelligence and his dirty tricks.
He’s always surrounded by a host of klutzy and noisy followers, who are always eager to get up to some mischief.
On this apparently peaceful day, something is about to happen.
A toxic waste spill has caused a very contagious disease.
What a mess you’ve made smart guy.
Our friends are in great danger; the illness is spreading quickly.
If JOHNNY PUFF doesn’t do anything to fix this disaster, everyone who lives in TAIGASVILLE will go totally cuckoo.
The grand reserve blueberry juice is the answer.
In the end, everything returns to normal; the air is pure and there’s a fresh breeze.
What better way to start the day than to play around with your friends?
While they’re having fun,
OTTO is working in his laboratory on his latest invention, some electromagnetic devices with very special purposes.
Today the little guys are expecting a visit from someone very special.
LEOPOLD is going to bring them some delicious, fresh-baked muffins.
But mysteriously, no one is home.
OTTO has to learn that with great power comes great responsibility.
Or is that from another movie?




The drills are booming in the early morning hours.
And OTTO’s helpers are livelier than usual.
Near the forest, the gang is playing and having fun, although a few are thinking more about filling their bellies.
Hmmm…
It looks like they’ve seen something that’s captured their attention.
The elders in the town those that still remember anything, of course tell the story of how some magic medallions with amazing powers were lost.
On the highest peak live LEOPOLD and BERTHA, two very peculiar otters.
In their opinion, everything that happens in TAIGASVILLE is a plot, so they’re always expecting the worst.
Let’s just say that… hey’re obsessed with finding life on other planets and they’re always ready for beings from outer space to knock on their door some day.
It’s time to enjoy the silence and observe the starry sky.
Although TAC snores like a walrus.
Snowmobiles are roaring in the middle of the night.
What devious scheme are they plotting now?
Oh, no! They’ve destroyed this year’s harvest!…
Cheer up, TIC, it’s not that bad!
Captured, imprisoned, and with no visiting hours.
OTTO’s henchmen lead them to his lair.
They’ll give them a taste of their own medicine.
It’s time for a prisoner exchange and to get back something that’s very valuable to the PUFFINS: the delicious blueberries that drive them wild!
So many slip-ups are beginning to get to OTTO, who is desperate to try a bite.
Step right up!
The great magician TAC has come to town!
His magical powers defy belief.
In the meantime, in the town square,
ALBERT, the local scientist and doctor, is preparing a display of fireworks.




It looks like OTTO is already cooking up some new bit of mischief.
The greedy pig has been left with nothing to fill his considerable tummy.
But he never expects the generosity of our little buddies, who are always ready to share.
The work day in the tower begins early.
Here they never take a day of vacation.
It’s a lovely day and our friends don’t want to miss the opportunity to make the most of it.
As long as some relentless walrus doesn’t ruin the fun.
At this decisive moment,
TIC has to face his fears and believe in himself.
The team needs him.
Once again, he achieved nothing with his dirty tricks.
Won’t he ever learn that the important thing is to participate?!
Today JOHNNY PUFF has to make a trip and he won’t be back until tomorrow, but he hopes his buddies will be responsible and will take care of his most prized…
…possession.
TAC knows how important this job is and he wants to make sure that JOHNNY’s guitar will be safe until he returns.
The plan flopped.
Who’s going to wake up OTTO and give the boss the bad news?
A new day begins, and it’s time to get up.
As always, there’s somebody who refuses to open his eyes.
The sleepy head of the group.
In his lair, the engineer is already plotting something and ready to cause trouble.
The guys are practicing for a recital, but they sound like a box full of crickets.
What an adventure!
It looks like JOHNNY did a good job preparing his friends.
Although he wasn’t aware of a thing, what he taught them helped them to save him.




It’s gotten very cold in TAIGASVILLE and the little bunny rabbits have found a very odd way to warm up.
On this calm day, everyone is having fun, completely unaware that a new adventure is about to begin.
The inhabitants of TAIGASVILLE are Fed up because OTTO won’t stop bothering them and polluting the air.
Someone has to put this selfish bully in his place!
Hiding the snowmobile wasn’t such a good idea.
After all, those machines have GPS in them nowadays.
Thanks to their great teamwork, the gang was able to find a solution.
Peace and calm has returned to the little town.
And the gang is enjoying a lovely morning fishing… but a new and revolutionary invention might stir up some trouble.
As always, OTTO expects to profit from this.
Let that be a lesson to you!
There’s no rival too big, nor any small enemies.
The next morning, he and his flunkeys prepare the way to take control of the lake.
Unaware of what’s going on, our friends head for the lake in search of fun and games.
To resolve the argument, they’ve organized a big race.
Nobody knows who will win, but everyone gets ready for the challenge.
It’s all or nothing!
Whoever reaches the finish line will take control of the lake.
PIE has won the race.
So they can continue to enjoy the lake and all its natural beauty.
Back home again, it’s time to celebrate the victory with a big feast with friends.
OTTO will have to turn around and take a hike with all his drilling machines.
Their stubborn rival, however, is preparing a new plot.
Will he be able to distract the PUFFINS so he can steal their magic medallion?
In the end, their plan backfired and they were the ones who weren’t paying attention… well, and someone else.
The first rays of sunlight light up the Arctic and, as always, he has decided to have some fun in the worst way possible.
And right below, in the depths at the bottom of the ocean, our friends are playing on an old sunken galleon.
It’s time to change the rules of the game!
The team goes home in low spirits.
They don’t know how to fix this ecological disaster.
Thanks to ALBERT and his clever inventions.
The water has regained its crystal-clear blue color and the marine life is thriving again.
And do you know who is the first one to want to take advantage of this situation?
OTTO, as always, is up to his old tricks.
But our little buddies got there first.
It’s getting late and OTTO’s lackeys are working hard to bring him a big catch.
Greedy old OTTO.
Cheating never brings anything good, and once again, he’s left with zilch, zip, nada.
Welcome everyone to the DIDI BAILARINI dance school.
As you can imagine, the group’s influencer is going to teach you.
Otto has come up with the perfect plan.
Once more, he’ll need the help of his henchmen to ensure success.
Once again, OTTO hasn’t learned the lesson.
He fell victim to his own trap.
It doesn’t look like OTTO has any more secret plans left, and he doesn’t realize that our friends are always willing to help him out.
While everyone in town is having fun, evil OTTO is pushing on in his tower on wheels.
A mysterious box has appeared, and his followers, bursting with curiosity, get out to inspect it.
It looks like this time they’re the ones who have come up with a clever plan.
Today is a day of celebration, it’s JOHNNY PUFF’s birthday and they’ve prepared a big party in his honor.
OTTO is down in the dumps.




None of his plans is ever successful.
Nevertheless, his underlings are planning a surprise to try to lift his spirits.
The party can continue, it’s time to celebrate.
Even some visitors from a galaxy far, far away have come to celebrate.
Who would’ve thought that that LEOPOLD and BERTHA were right after all?!
OTTO, grumpier and grumpier, has even lost his appetite.
Ohhh, nooo!
He’s already got a new gizmo to create more mischief.
The band of friends has just gotten ahold of a new balloon.
He’s decided to bring out the heavy artillery.
A new snowball gun!
A big competition is going to be held at the lake today, and everybody is eager for it to start.
OTTO is stubborn as a mule and sticks to his guns. He refuses to learn that no matter how hard he tries, his pranks always have consequences.
There’s trouble in the fortress.
They’re running out of energy fast and need to find a solution quickly.
But that solution might have serious consequences for the ecosystem.
In the end, everything has returned to normal, thanks to group’s teamwork.
And so balance is restored in the Arctic.
Today an unexpected visitor has arrived at the tower.
There’s nothing better than a mother’s advice to put you in the right path.
In the meantime, back home, the little band of friends is enjoying a great summer day, playing and having fun under the sun.
What they’re not expecting is very special invitation.
Everyone is curious to meet his mother.
The time to say goodbye has come.
Everyone has come to see her off and wish her a good trip home.
It looks like the advice she gave her son is having an effect.
Or maybe not."

Oh, that’s a big fella.
Whoa!
Looks great.
Thank you.
Happy vacation, honey.
Ooh.
Manchurian tung oil. Where did you get this?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Well, there’s enough here to do the whole table and the bureau.
Hmm.
I wonder what this could be.
Oh, honey, you got it. Thank you.
Enough there to do the entire guest room.
I’m so glad we’re spending our vacation at home.
I’m gonna get started right away.
Well, hey, where are you going?
[GIGGLES]
[PHONE RINGING]
I’ll get it.
Be my guest.
I’ll just get the…
[LAUGHS]




Maybe you should get it.
I’ll go.
Okay. No!
[LAUGHS]
[CAR DRIVING UP ON GRAVEL]
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
Ugh, Jane.
It’s your turn, honey.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Hi, Barbara.
Hi.
Glad I caught you. Heard you were on vacation.
That’s right. Complete vacation.
Honey, today I’m $260,000.
No, Jane.
It’s 6:45 in the morning.
This offer is real.
From a man in New York City who only saw a photograph.
Jane, don’t send people photos of our house.
He wants to bring the wife and family up here for some peace and quiet.
That’s exactly what we’re looking for.
But, Barbara, this house is too big for you.
It really ought to be for a couple with a family, you know…?




Oh, pumpkin, I didn’t mean anything. It’s just that this house is too big.
I’ll see you in a few weeks. Okay?
Okay.
All right.
Think about it.
BARBARA: Take care.
[HARRY BELAFONTE’S “MAN SMART, WOMA SMARTER” PLAYING]
Boo!
I was just telling Barbara about this offer…
No, Jane.
Adam.
[MUSIC STOPS]
Barbara, come with me down to the store.
What for?
I need a new brush for this tung oil.
And I want to get a part for the model.
Well, you just run in, okay?
ADAM: Two weeks at home. The perfect vacation.
BARBARA: Jane says we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Well, I don’t think that it’s any of Jane’s business.
Besides, we could try again on this vacation, you know.
Oh, really? What are you saying?
ADAM: How are you doing, Ernie?
ERNIE: Hi, how are you?
Morning, Adam.




Need a haircut before your vacation?
No, thanks, Bill.
How’s the model coming?
Oh, it’s great.
You know, you said Bozman built that foundation in 1835. But his grandson…
He got hair right down to his goddamn shoulders.
He says to me, “Just trim it a little.”
I took the scissors to him so fast…
See you later, huh, Bill?
BILL: Right.
This is gonna be great.
Are you sure you wouldn’t rather go to Jamaica or some place like that?
No way. There’s no place like home.
Hey, look out for that…!
[BARBARA SCREAMS]
[ADAM GROANS]
[BOTH SCREAMING]
[CUCKOOING]
BARBARA: Perfect start to our vacation.
Well, you’ll feel better when you’re dry, honey.
BARBARA: That fire wasn’t burning when we left.
How’s your arm?
I don’t know. It feels frozen.
[GASPS]
I’ll make some coffee and you get wood for the fire.




Maybe we should just take things extra slow.
Do you remember how we got back up here?
I’m gonna go back down to the bridge and retrace our steps.
[GROWLING NEARBY]
You saved my…
Two hours.
Barbara, you are not gonna believe… What?
That’s how long you were gone.
What is going on?
I have to show you something.
Look.
There’s that.
And there’s that.
“Handbook for the Recently Diseased.”
Deceased.
“Deceased.”
I don’t know where it came from. Look at the publisher.
“Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.”
You know what? I don’t think we survived the crash.
I hate this.
Just… Can you give me the basics?
Well, this book isn’t arranged that way. What do you wanna know?
Well, why did you disappear when you stepped off the porch?
Are we halfway to heaven, are we halfway to hell?
And how long is this gonna last?
I don’t see anything about heaven or hell.
This book reads like stereo instructions. Listen to this:
“Geographical and Temporal Perimeters.
Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.”
Oh, this is gonna take some time, honey.
[BARBARA MOANS]
[MAN HUMMING]
Damn sandworms. Thirteen percent, huh?
Well, I better find a job. Let’s see. Business section.
Ooh-la-la.
What do we got here? The Maitlands, huh?
[CHUCKLES]
Cute couple. Look nice and stupid too.
[LAUGHS]
I wish I had a better view of the cemetery from here.
I can’t tell which is the best placement for us.
[SPUTTERS]
Cabin fever, hon?
Well, I can’t clean anything properly.
The vacuum’s out in the garage and we can’t leave the house.
Why don’t they tell us something? Where are all the other dead people?
Why is it just you and me?
Maybe this is heaven.
In heaven there wouldn’t be dust on everything.
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]




ADAM: It’s Jane.
BARBARA: God, what’s she doing here?
I don’t know. Hey, Jane, up here. Jane.
Can’t see you, right?
Uh-uh.
In the book, rule number two: “The living usually won’t see the dead.”
Won’t or can’t?
It just says “won’t.”
God, this book is so stupid. I can’t understand anything in there.
Barb, honey…
…we’re dead.
I don’t think we have very much to worry about anymore.
[RUMBLING]
BARBARA: Aah!
[BANGING DOWNSTAIRS]
MAN 1: Ah, this is great. This is just what the doctor ordered.
Sorry, ma’am.
Delia Deetz, welcome home.
Charles.
It’s okay, there’s no damage. Look, see? It’s okay.
Good, sturdy, country craftsmanship.
And look at that kitchen.
You’re finally gonna be able to cook a decent meal.
Come and have a look.
A little gasoline. Blowtorch. No problem.
Excuse me. Down we go.
CHARLES: We’ll have to rip out all the plumbing.
But other than that, it’s perfect. Just perfect.
What do you think, honey?
Delia hates it.
I could live here.
Careful. That’s my sculpture.
I don’t mean “my” as in “I bought it.” I mean I made it. It’s my sculpture.
Put it on the table.
Ten minutes. I’m already perfectly at ease.
It’s perfect.
[MAN 2 GRUNTING]
MAN 2: Help!
It’s Otho.
CHARLES: Otho, why don’t you just come in the front?
It’s bad luck.
Otho, you left the city for me. I am so happy.
Of course you are.
Delia.
You’re right.
Let’s get one thing straight.
You’re right.
We’re here to enjoy the country setting…
Mm-hm.
…not to trash the place.




You’re right.
OTHO: Charles, you’re lucky the yuppies are buying condos…
…so you can afford what I’m going to have to do to this place.
Otho, I’m here to relax and clip coupons, and, damn it, I mean to do it.
Then go do it quietly, dear, and let Otho and I think.
OTHO: Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
Is this a punishment or something?
What are we gonna do?
We’re not completely helpless, Barbara.
I’ve been reading that book and there’s a word for people in our situation.
Ghosts.
OTHO: Delia, let’s get this show on the road.
We’re dealing with negative entertainment potential.
I mean, there’s absolutely no organic flow-through.
I noticed that too. It’s like a giant ant farm.
What?
I thought I saw something.
OTHO: You’ve read my mind.
I did?
So few clients are able to read my mind.
They’re just not open to the experience.
Hmm.
[GASPS]
[SCREAMS]
My God.
We just have to pray the other closets are bigger than this one.
Ooh, look.
Ozzie and Harriet.
Ugh.
What happened to these people?
They died.
Oh, look, an indoor outhouse.
Otho.
Viridian.
Viridian. Now, why do I know that name?
Blue-green.
Hydrated chromic oxide.
Remember, I’m schooled in chemistry. I was a hair analyst.
What?
Briefly.
Yuck. Deliver me from L.L.Bean.
Boo!
Aah!
I know what you two are up to and you’re not gonna get away with it.
Oh, honey, this is not working out at all.
Charles, I will not stop living and breathing art just because you need to relax.
Ha.
DELIA: I’m here. I will live with you in this hellhole.
But I must express myself. If you don’t let me gut out this house…
…and make it my own, I will go insane and I will take you with me!
Yeah. Well, you know, maybe the house could use a little remodeling.
Uh, but why don’t you just leave this room alone, okay?
Okay.
I’m gonna get her.
So?
Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls…
…this place might just be livable.
What’s on the third floor?
Attic space.
Oh, I forgot to lock the attic door.
Did you feel something?
When?
[LOCK CLICKS]
[DOORKNOB RATTLES]
You don’t have a key?
Maybe Charles does.
I have a feeling there’s something very interesting behind this door.
Yeah, ghosts of the people who died in this house, and they want us out of here.
So let’s do them a favor.
My God, that was close.
BARBARA: I cannot watch this.
What’s the good of being a ghost if you can’t frighten people away?
Honey.
No, I’m not putting up with this.
[SCREAMS]
Barbara, you don’t know what’s out there.
I don’t care.
ADAM: Barbara!
BARBARA: Adam.
Adam?
Barbara.
BARBARA: Adam!
Adam. Oh, help.
Barbara.
Help, I’m getting all yellow.
[GROWLING NEARBY]
[ROARS]
[GROWLING]
[WHIMPERS]
Adam!
Oh, Adam.
We’re trapped in this house with those people.
I can’t believe we’re eating Cantonese. Is there no Sichuan up here?
Plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that’s in this food.
This is our first meal in this house…
…so why don’t we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Don’t bait your mother, pumpkin.
Soon as we get settled, we’ll build you a darkroom in the basement, okay?
My whole life is a darkroom.
One big dark room.
So you were miserable in New York City…
…and now you’re going to be miserable out here in the sticks.
At least someone’s life hasn’t been upheaved.
I’m perfectly happy here. Those people in New York…
…they just don’t know what they’re missing.
You know, we could become The Summer Art Center of New York.
I could start sculpting again. I’m only truly happy when I’m sculpting.
That’s a very good idea. That’ll be, um, ahem, very time-consuming.
First the house. Otho and I have some great plans.
I think we should keep it the way it is.
Good idea.
Furniture truck is coming. We’re gonna have to decide what goes and what stays.
Everything goes, along with whatever’s in the attic.
Put it up. Come on.
Careful.
You see, if you tell me what you do I’ll tell you why my husband will fire you.
Isn’t there an index or something?
No, nothing.
All right, now.
What’s this?
DELIA: No, no, I’m sorry. That does not go there.
Do you know where that’s going? Did anyone tell you where to…?
Why are there only three sculptures? There were four sculptures here.
Where’s the fourth sculpture? No!
No, what are you doing?
Excuse me. Put it down.
“Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist. Troubled by the living?
Is death a problem and not the solution? Unhappy with eternity?
Having difficulty adjusting? Call Betelgeuse.”
[CRASHING OUTSIDE]
DELIA: Put it down.
Betelgeu… Betel…
That’s it? There’s no number or instructions?
Nothing. The “bio-exorcist.” I don’t get it.
[CRASHING OUTSIDE]
DELIA: Would you put that down?
Straight back.
DELIA: Why is that still up there?
Why don’t you guys take a break for about half an hour, okay?
MAN: Uh-huh.
Jesus Christ!
DELIA: What are you doing? Put that down.
What the hell are you doing out there?
DELIA: Listen to me. No!
Jesus.
Why are you doing this to me? This is my art and it is dangerous.
Do you think I want to die like this?
[CAR HORN HONKS]
No, no.
Hi. How are you?
That little girl saw us.
Honey, nobody can see us.
But she did.
What happened to the previous owners?
They drowned.
Yes, they were family. I was devastated.
Here, take that.
Is this the key to the attic?
That’s a skeleton key. That key will open any door in the house.
Give that to your father.
And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated that house.
In case he needs any advice in that arena, have him come see me.
[STAIRCASE CREAKING]
Don’t worry. I locked the door.
[LOCK RATTLING]
[STATIC ON TV]
[BETELGEUSE LAUGHING]
Having trouble with the living? You tired of having your home violated?
You want to get rid of them pesky living critters?
Well, come on down and see me, folks, I’m the afterlife’s leading bio-exorcist.
Yes, sirree. Come on down here and I want to tell you, I’ll do anything.
I’ll scare them real bad. The point is, folks, I’m gonna do anything to get your business.
Hell, I’ll possess myself if I gotta.
Wow! Yo, I got demons running all through me.
All through me. Come on down here and see it.
And hey, if you act now, you get a free demon possession with every exorcism.
You can’t beat that, can you?
And bring the little pards down.
Hell, we got plenty of snakes and lizards for them to play with. No problem at all.
So say it once, say it twice, third time’s the charm. And remember:
I’ll eat anything you want me to eat Swallow anything you want me to swallow.
So come on down, I’ll chew on the dog
[HOWLS]
We need some help. I read something in this book this morning about emergencies.
All right, here it is. “In case of emergency, draw a door.”
“Draw a door”? I don’t know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Hey, maybe we should try that “Beetle” guy.
Oh.
You didn’t actually think that was gonna work, did you?
Aha!
“Knock three times.”
[RUMBLING]
Blugh.
[WHISTLES]
Birdies.
Get it.
LYDIA: Dad.
Can’t you see I’m relaxing in here?
Well, I wanna tell you what I saw.
What is the point of my coming up here if you people won’t let me relax?
Pumpkin, sweetheart…
…go help your mother.
Maybe you can relax in a haunted house, but I can’t.
Hmm.
Nice building. Bad roof. Good parking.
[GASPS]
Adam?
This way, honey.
You don’t have an appointment, do you?
Well, we didn’t know how to make one.
Appointment for what?
What do you want?
We need some help.
Ha! Already?
You just bit the big one two months ago and you want help.
What does that have to do with anything?
You’re gonna use up all your help vouchers: D-90s.
You spend 125 years on Earth actually in that house…
…during which you get only three class-one D-90 intercessions with Juno.
You probably haven’t even read through the manual completely yet.
You’ll have to wait if you don’t have an appointment.
An appointment with whom?
For Juno, your caseworker.
Number 54,000,601. Ferndock.
Want a cigarette?
Uh, no, thank you.
Trying to cut down myself.
Adam, is this what happens when you die?
This is what happens when you die.
That is what happens when he dies. And that is what happens when they die.
It’s all very personal. And I’ll tell you something.
If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn’t have had my little accident.
[CHUCKLING]
Maitland. Party of two.
Take the handbook and go to the sixth door.
Oh, we forgot our handbook.
[MUTTERING]
Come on.
WOMAN: [OVER PA] All new arrivals, report to Waiting Room Number 8.
Flight 409 is arriving at Gate 3.
How do I look? There are no mirrors on this side.
Fine. You look fine.
Yeah?
Fine.
Thanks. I’ve been feeling a little flat.
[LAUGHING]
WOMAN: [OVER PA] Will the Peterson party report to Door Number 9?
Peterson party, please report to Door Number 9.
All new arrivals, report to Waiting Room Number 8.
A hundred and 25 years. I can’t believe this.
I can’t believe they didn’t tell us.
[GHOSTS MOANING]
Oh, Adam, what is this?
That’s the Lost Souls’ Room.
A room for ghosts that have been exorcised.
Poor devils.
That’s death for the dead.
It’s all in the handbook.
Keep moving.
Five.
This is the sixth door.
Boy, oh, boy, this place just gets weirder and weirder.
Barbara.
We’re home.
Look at this place. Everything’s different.
All our furniture’s gone.
How long do you suppose we were waiting there?
Three months.
I’d almost given up on you. I was about to leave.
I do have other clients.
Are you Juno, our caseworker?
Yes.
I evaluate individual cases and determine…
…if help is needed, deserved and available.
Are you available?
No.
What’s wrong?
We’re very unhappy.
What did you expect? You’re dead.
We want to get rid of the people who moved in here.
Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
We probably wouldn’t mind sharing the house with people who were…
More like you used to be.
Yes.
But these people…
Things seem pretty quiet here.
You should thank God you didn’t die in Italy.
The Deetzes.
Okay, have you been studying the manual?
Well, we tried.
The intermediate interface chapter on haunting says it all.
Get them out yourselves. It’s your house.
Haunted houses aren’t easy to come by.
Well, we don’t quite get it.
I heard.
Tore your faces right off.
It doesn’t do any good to pull your heads off in front of people…
…if they can’t see you.
We should start more simply?
Start simply.
Do what you know. Use your talents. Practice.
You should have been studying those lessons since day one.
[WATCH BEEPING]
Ooh. I’ve got to go.
What about that guy in the flyer, Betel…?
Shh!
Don’t even say his name. You don’t want his help.
Well…
We might.
No, you don’t. He does not work well with others.
What do you mean?
I didn’t want to bring it up.
But rather than have you stumble onto it and make another mistake, I’ll tell you.
He was my assistant.
But he was a troublemaker. He went out on his own…
…as a freelance bio-exorcist.
Claimed he could get rid of the living. Got into more trouble.
[SIGHS]
In fact, I believe he’s been sleazing around your cemetery lately.
The only way he can be brought back…
…is by calling his name three times.
But I strongly suggest…
…that you remove the Deetzes yourselves.
Well, how do we contact you if we need you again?
Oh, Adam, that guy’s in our cemetery.
She’s right, honey. We just have to keep this simple. We can do this. Come on.
[FLY BUZZING]
BETELGEUSE: Hey, you. Hey, come here.
Hungry?
Come on. Hey, come here.
I got something good for you. Come on. Come on over.
We’ll have a little bite, you’ll have something to nosh.
[LAUGHS]
Come here. FLY: Help me. Help me. Help me.
[BETELGEUSE BELCHES]
Maxie, have I not always made you money? I think that’s the only real question here.
Well, Charles, nobody made me money like you.
I mean, before your nerves went, you were a demon.
It’s just that Winter River, Connecticut is, if you’ll forgive me, nowhere.
Why would I wanna invest that kind of money in an old building…
…way the hell up there?
It’s not a building. That’s the beauty of it.
These people don’t know the value of their property. I can buy the whole town.
Oh, then we own a whole town in the middle of nowhere.
Max, you’ve got to come up here and see.
CHARLES: [OVER PHONE] And, uh, bring Sarah.
Yeah, all right, Charles. It’s just that I am kind of busy here.
[MOANING NEARBY]
Uh, just a minute, Maxie.
Now, listen. Enough of this talk about visiting, okay? I gotta go.
MAXIE: [OVER PHONE] You take it easy up there, big fellow.
Goodbye.
Uh, Max, wait, wait, wait.
[DIAL TONE OVER PHONE]
Putz.
[MOANING NEARBY]
Jeez, Lydia, is Connecticut so boring? I had Maxie Dean on the phone, honey.
Dad’s found a way of making some money while I relax, so would you scram?
Your mother’s gonna kill you when she sees you cut holes in her $300 sheets.
This is so corny. Is this what we’ve been reduced to? Sheets?
ADAM: Think of them as death shrouds.
And the moaning is important. Really moan.
[BOTH MOANING]
[ADAM AND BARBARA MOANING NEARBY]
[SIGHS]
God, how can he stand that woman?
Cut it out. I’m a child, for God’s sakes.
BARBARA: I feel so stupid. ADAM: It’s not stupid. We’re ghosts.
Do you want to spend the next 125 years having breakfast with this woman?
Moan louder.
[BOTH MOANING LOUDLY]
[TV CLICKS OFF]
ADAM: Oh, God.
[ADAM SIGHS]
[CAMERA CLICKING AND WHIRRING]
Sick. Sexual perversion.
If you guys are gonna do that weird sexual stuff, do it in your own bedroom.
No feet.
Are you the guys hiding out in the attic?
ADAM: [MOANING] We’re ghosts.
BARBARA: Whoo!
What do you look like under there? ADAM: Aren’t you scared?
I’m not scared of sheets. Are you gross under there?
Are you Night of the Living Dead under there?
Like all bloody veins and pus?
Night of the what?
Living Dead. It’s a movie.
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been scared out of my wits.
You’re not gross. Why are you wearing sheets?
We’re practicing.
You can see us without the sheets?
Of course I can see you.
Well, how is it that you see us and nobody else can?
Well, I read through that Handbook for the Recently Deceased.
It says, “Live people ignore the strange and unusual.”
I myself am strange and unusual.
You look like a regular girl to me.
ADAM: You read our book?
Yeah.
You could follow it?
Yeah. Why were you in Delia’s bedroom?
We were trying to scare your mother.
Stepmother.
Anyway, you can’t scare her. She’s sleeping with Prince Valium tonight.
You did this? You carved all these little houses and things?
Mm-hm.
And this used to be your house.
Why do you want to scare everybody?
Well, we wanted to frighten you so you would move out.
[LAUGHS]
You don’t know the Deetzes very well.
My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity.
Why don’t you leave?
We can’t.
We haven’t left the house since the funeral.
Funeral.
God. You guys really are dead.
This is amazing.
CHARLES: Lydia.
I better go.
Wait.
Don’t tell your parents that we’re up here.
Unless you think it’ll frighten them away.
You tell them that we are horrible…
…desperate, ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get our house back.
What if this is a dream? Can you guys do any tricks to prove I’m not dreaming?
Well, if you are real ghosts, you guys better get another routine because those sheets…
…they don’t work.
DELIA: Ghosts.
You’re telling me we have ghosts in this house.
Those pictures are of ghosts. Are they?
Ghosts.
Lydia, I am giving a dinner party tonight for seven people.
My agent, Bernard, is bringing a woman who writes for Art in America.
In fact, no one dining here this evening has not been in Vanity Fair except you.
I told them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don’t you dare speak to others about me.
Being embarrassed in front of the few people who will set foot in here scares me.
So let’s play family just for tonight, hmm?
Lydia’s trying, but they don’t believe her.
She’s got photos, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Bigfoot.
My photo of Bigfoot is a different story.
Anyhow, we’ve gotta get some help here.
We’ve gotta contact this guy, Betelmeyer, or something.
Adam.
Look.
It’s him. Betelgeuse.
Betelgeuse.
Go ahead, Barbara, say it.
Betelgeuse.
What happened?
I think we’re in the model.
Hey, look at that.
Well, where is he? What do we do?
Looks like we dig, Barbara.
[ADAM GRUNTS]
Oh, it’s about time.
I say we open it.
Maybe we should knock first.
Yeah.
Adam. Babs.
Boy, do you know how to pick them. Is this relationship solid? Do I have a shot at her?
Excuse me.
Sure. Am I overstepping my bounds?
Just tell me. Come on. Know what’s beautiful about this?
You two kids picked me. You didn’t have to, but you picked me.
It makes me want to kiss you guys. Come on, give me one.
No!
I beg your pardon.
All right, let’s get down to business.
I’ve got a card here somewhere. Here. Who do I have to kill?
Here, hold that for me, will you?
[BARBARA SCREAMS]
There you go.
You don’t have to kill anybody.
Ah, possession. Good.
BETELGEUSE: Learn to throw your voice. Fool your friends. Fun at parties.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] No. We just wanna get some people out of our house.
I understand. Well, look, in order to do that, I’m gonna have to get to know you guys.
We’ve got to get closer. Move in with you for a while.
Get to be real pals. You know what I’m saying? In…
[SNORTS]
Save that guy for later, huh?
My wife and I would like to ask a couple of questions.
Sure, sure, sure. Go ahead. Shoot.
For instance, what are your qualifications?
[IN CULTURED VOICE] Ah. Well, I attended Juilliard.
I’m a graduate of the Harvard Business School.
I lived through the Black Plague. And I had a pretty good time during that.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] I’ve seen The Exorcist about 167 times…
…and it keeps getting funnier every single time I see it.
Not to mention the fact that you’re talking to a dead guy.
Now, what do you think? You think I’m qualified?
What I mean is, can you be scary?
Oh! Oh.
I know what you’re asking me. Can I be scary?
What do you think of this?
[BOTH SCREAM]
You like it?
Will you excuse us, please?
Sure. Talk amongst yourself.
Adam, let’s go.
I know, but I think he can be useful later.
BARBARA: We can work something out.
Oh, yeah.
BARBARA: Hey, hey, hey. ADAM: Excuse me.
What?
Excuse me. We are leaving now.
Oh, come on. Don’t go yet.
Hey, guy, come on. We’re simpatico here.
Look at us, huh? We even shop at the same store.
Hey, hermano.
Yeah, there you go.
Hey, come on. We’re like peas in a pod, the three of us. Let’s face it.
You want somebody out of the house. I want to get somebody out of your house.
Look. We’ve been to Saturn. Hey, I’ve been to Saturn.
Whoa. Sandworms.
You hate them, right? I hate them myself.
Come on, kids, what do I have to do to strike a deal with you two, huh?
[SCREAMING]
Don’t you hate it when that happens?
Let’s go.
Wait a minute. Just come up for a while. We’ll talk inside. Come on. Come on.
BARBARA: I’m not staying here.
The place is a mess.
We have to get out of here.
I’ll fix you something to eat.
Home. Home. Home.
Barbara, how did you do that?
Hope you like Italian.
Where’d you go? Hey, come on. Hey, where’d you go?
Hey. Come on. You’ve got to work with me here.
I’m just trying to cut a deal. What do you want me to do?
Where are you?
You bunch of losers!
You’re working with a professional here.
Nice fucking model.
[HONKING]
BARBARA: See, we can do this stuff on our own.
Besides, I’m not exposing that little girl to that pervert down there.
Barbara, we did call him, and he seemed awfully pissed off.
I don’t care. I’ve changed my mind.
Listen, I think we can scare them off ourselves, tonight.
I have an idea.
I think what you did with the place is wonderful.
[WHISPERING] Not me. Them.
So?
Oh. Um…
[BERNARD CLEARS THROAT]
Uh…
You like them.
I just hope it wasn’t yet another of your dreary suicide attempts.
You know what they say about people who commit suicide?
In the afterlife, they become civil servants.
[CHUCKLES]
Otho, I didn’t realize you were into the supernatural.
Well, of course. You remember.
After my stint with The Living Theatre…
…I was one of New York City’s leading paranormal researchers…
…until the bottom dropped out in ’72.
Paranormal? Is that what they’re calling your kind these days?
Don’t mind her. She’s still upset because somebody dropped a house on her sister.
Well, this looks really good.
I saw some ghosts.
It’s a little private joke Lydia and I share.
It’s not a joke.
Yes, it is. Just today she tried to convince me that this house is haunted.
Kids. You know, I love them.
By ghosts?
In designer sheets, no less.
I’d like to propose a toast to our intrepid friends…
…who braved the expressway and two dozen tollbooths to be with us.
May your buildings go condo.
Now, Lydia, favor us about your ghosts.
No. I am sick of that subject.
Oh, Delia, lighten up.
I would rather talk about…
[SINGING “DAY-O” IN HARRY BELAFONTE’S VOICE]
That’s cute, Delia.
[CHUCKLES]
Otho, are you doing this?
[ALL SINGING]
[ALL SCREAMING]
We did it.
Let’s watch them scatter.
Any minute now they’re gonna come running out of that door screaming.
Any minute now.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
LYDIA: It’s me, Lydia.
They want you to come downstairs.
Delia says you can wear any sheets you want.
It was like being in an amusement park.
[LAUGHING] Wham!
I didn’t even know I could do the Calypso.
Who has more fun than us?
We’re dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here.
A very sophisticated pair. I mean, they even appear in sheets.
[LAUGHS]
Charles, what I wanna know is why didn’t you tell us about this before?
Well, we’re not even sure we want our secret out.
I mean, everyone’s gonna want them for their parties, ha, ha.
People will pay big money for this, Grace.
The Enquirer is offering $50,000 for proof of life after death.
DELIA: Fifty thousand?
This is it, Charles. You can get Maxie Dean up here now.
You think so?
Sarah loves the supernatural.
She’ll have him sprint up here in his helicopter…
…if you can produce ghosts for her.
Oh, Charles.
I should remind you all that I am Delia’s agent.
I have consistently lost money on her work for years.
If anything actually happened here, I shall handle it.
But not until I’ve seen some real proof.
But, Bernard, what about this table?
What just happened, what was that?
And what money? Don’t you believe in my work?
CHARLES: Uh-uh-uh!
Here’s Lydia.
Well?
They don’t want to come down.
DELIA: Charles.
Why not?
I think the reason is that they were trying to scare you away, and you didn’t get scared.
Please, they’re dead. It’s a little late to be neurotic.
All right.
This was not a hallucination. This was real.
We all just experienced a very super-powerful paranormal experience and it was real.
Delia, you are a flake. You have always been a flake.
If you insist on frightening people, do it with your sculpture.
CHARLES: Drive carefully.
I’m dead.
Where do they hide out?
The attic.
The attic’s locked.
They’re ghosts, Dad. They can do what they want.
Yeah, they do whatever they want. Lydia, you take us up there right now.
Fabulous. Otho Fenlock’s “Locked Door Ghosts.”
Probably committed suicide up there.
I’m totally enchanted. DELIA: They’re in there?
They must live like animals.
It’s locked. How did they get in?
Open this door, you dead people, or we’ll bust it down…
…and drag you out by the ropes you hanged yourself with.
They didn’t commit suicide.
It doesn’t matter.
I have a chance to teach you something. Take the upper hand in all situations…
…or people, whether dead or alive, will walk all over you.
Open up!
So where are they?
Listen, you guys, these ghosts are really nice people.
I think we scared them away, so let’s just leave them alone, all right?
It’s the whole damn town.
I have never been so embarrassed. They haven’t gone for good, have they?
Hmm.
CHARLES: Beep, beep.
Dad, don’t. Mom, let’s just go.
No ghosts here.
Come on. If they are in here, I don’t want to scare them away.
Well, we’re leaving now. You can go about your business.
CHARLES: What are we doing? DELIA: Quick, quick, quick.
[BETELGEUSE LAUGHING]
Oh, boy. You guys are really a couple of spooksters, aren’t you?
Now, let’s turn on the juice and see what shakes loose.
Otho, you get Maxie on the phone. We’ve really got something here.
We can turn this place into the world’s leading supernatural research center.
An amusement park. I’ll do a presentation. Lydia will bring the ghosts.
I can’t bring the ghosts, Dad. They’re not here.
Otho, can’t you do something?
Perhaps. If I’m properly motivated.
Just what type of motivation do you require, Otho?
LYDIA: Why don’t you leave them alone? They didn’t do anything to you.
[RATTLING]
[DELIA GASPS]
[HISSING] Hi.
[SCREAMS]
[CHUCKLING]
Whoa!
[BETELGEUSE LAUGHS]
We’ve come for your daughter, Chuck.
Stop. Stop.
Yeah.
Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse.
Oh, no.
Why are you doing this?
Leave me alone, all of you.
Great choice we got here. We spend the next century…
…either hanging out the window or doing parlor tricks.
Maybe they’ll leave now. That snake was a nasty customer.
Well, he could’ve hurt somebody.
But he didn’t.
We’ve got them right where we want them.
You bunch of losers. How dare you interrupt a professional while he’s working.
I’m not fond of Charles Deetz, but you could’ve killed him.
Hey, I’m just doing my job. Besides, I thought we had a deal.
Hey, it’s okay. You know why?
I don’t wanna do business with you deadbeats anyway, thank you.
The only one I think I can deal with is Edgar Allan Poe’s daughter.
I think she understands me.
You leave her alone, you…
Ow!
Go ahead, make my millennium.
[LAUGHING]
Yeah.
I’m feeling a little, uh, ooh, anxious, if you know what I mean.
It’s been about 600 years, after all.
I wonder where a guy, an everyday Joe like myself…
…can find a little action.
WOMAN: Hi.
Yeah.
WOMAN: Come on. Come on in.
Oh, yeah. Here I come, baby.
Oh, yeah. Hey, Adam, nice move.
Adam, why did you build that?
I didn’t.
WOMAN: [OVER PA] All new arrivals report to Waiting Room Number 8.
Will you guys shut up and leave me alone?
I’ve got all this paperwork to do.
You two, come in here. Sit down.
Get in here, both of you.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture.
You two have really screwed up.
I received word you allowed yourselves to be photographed.
And you let Betelgeuse out and didn’t put him back.
And you let Otho get hold of the handbook.
The handbook? When?
Never trust the living.
We cannot have a routine haunting like yours…
…provide proof that there is existence beyond death.
Coach. Coach, where’s the men’s room? FOOTBALL PLAYER: Yeah.
I’m not your coach. He survived.
FOOTBALL PLAYER: Wait, coach, let me get something straight.
What’s our curfew around here?
Will you get out of here?
Go on, get downstairs. “Men’s room.”
Are you kidding? Can’t you read signs?
I’ll be right back.
FOOTBALL PLAYER: Come on. Get out of my way.
Maybe this was all a bad idea.
I didn’t say anything.
Oh, who are we kidding, Charles? You’ve never had a bad idea.
Yeah?
Yeah, this could all work out.
Home.
Though…
…I’m not sure that this is the right environment for Lydia.
Snakes. Ghosts.
Shrimp.
You family types.
You’ve got other things to worry about. Maxie Dean’s coming up here tonight.
You’ve got to figure out a way to sell these ghosts. I can only do so much.
What are you gonna do, Otho? Viciously rearrange their environment?
I know just as much about the supernatural as I do about interior design.
“I am…”
“…alone.”
“I am…”
“…utterly…”
“…alone.”
“By the time…”
“…you read this…”
“…I will…”
“…be gone…”
“…having jumped…”
“Having plummeted…”
“…off…”
“…the Winter River Bridge.”
So I don’t care what it takes.
You get the Deetzes out of there now.
WOMAN: [OVER PA] Flight 409 arriving.
Whoa, wait a minute.
WOMAN: [OVER PA] Flight 409 is arriving.
What are you going to do?
To scare them.
I want to make sure it’s not some silly parlor trick.
I’ll go first, honey.
[ADAM GRUNTS]
[SQUISHING]
Not bad. Not bad. Now you.
Go ahead.
Okay, you look great.
Now, go clean house and don’t forget the photographs and the damned handbook.
WOMAN: [OVER PA] Please report to Door Number 9.
All new arrivals, report to Waiting Room Number 8.
Coach? JUNO: What?
I don’t think we survived that crash.
How did you guess?
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?
Hello?
Where are you? BETELGEUSE: Dead.
Dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they’re dead. They’re ghosts.
No, I mean they’re gone. Split. Out of here. Afterlife kids.
Deceased.
Are you a ghost too?
I’m the ghost with the most, babe.
You know, you look like somebody I can relate to.
Maybe you could help me get out of here, you know, because…
…I gotta tell you, this, uh, death thing…
[CRUNCHING]
It’s just too creepy.
See, here’s my problem.
I got these friends on the outside that I said I’d meet.
You know, I have to be there in person, you know.
So I was just wondering, could you help me get out of here?
I wanna get in.
Why?
Well, you know…
…hey, you’ve probably got your reasons, but I can’t do anything from over here.
If you could get me out, over there, then maybe we could talk or something.
But, you know, in order to do that you’ve gotta say my name three times.
What’s your name?
Well, uh, I can’t tell you.
Why not?
Because if I tell you, you’ll tell your friends, they’re calling me on the horn all the time.
I’ve gotta show up at shopping centers for openings, sign autographs, shit like that.
And it makes my life a hell, okay? A living hell.
But maybe if you have a pen, maybe we can… I know. You ever play charades?
Yeah.
Good. Good.
Ahh, here we go then. Ready?
Um, two words.
Right.
First word, two syllables.
Look.
You know, just turn around.
I don’t know what your signal means.
Turn around and look behind you.
Hi. How are you?
Beetle.
Got it. Okay, now, two.
Breakfast? Orange? Orange beetle?
Beetle fruit?
Beetle breakfast?
Beetle drink?
Beetle…
Beetle juice?
Yes. That’s it.
Your name’s Betelgeuse?
You said it twice. Just say it once more. Come on.
It was you, wasn’t it?
Wha…? Me?
The snake.
No, what snake? You kids and your imagination.
Just say it.
No.
I want to talk to Barbara.
No, you don’t need to talk to Barbara. Just say it.
Oh, Adam, I can’t go through with it. I like that little girl.
But, Barbara, honey, it’s too late. We have to go through with this.
No, we don’t. I mean, can’t we rebel or something?
[ADAM SIGHS]
Barbara.
Adam, I want to be with Lydia.
Come on. Just say it.
ADAM: No! BARBARA: No! Lydia, don’t say it.
You. Say it.
It’s okay. It’s okay. It’s us. What’s going on?
Betel…
Shh!
He told me that if I let him out he would take me to the other side to find you.
No, Lydia, we’re dead.
I wanna be dead too.
No.
Lydia…
…being dead really doesn’t make things any easier.
Listen to her on this, Lydia. This is something we know a lot about.
And you can come up here and visit us anytime you want.
I have a feeling things are going to be a little better around here from now on.
[GRUNTING]
What do you mean, better?
Well, we’ve decided that we’re going to invite you and your family to stay.
That’s right, Lydia.
OTHO: Why can’t we bring Maxie up here?
You’ve got a stake in this too.
This is a presentation. It requires a sense of occasion, a sense of style.
It’s so big. How will we get it out?
It’s sectional.
Wait, there are plugs.
Careful.
Okay, go.
What’s going on?
I don’t know. I’ll go find out.
Be careful.
We’ve got Ed Cornwall to head the wax museum…
…dedicated to 50 great moments of the paranormal here in Thanksgiving Park.
Now, you must remember Ed, Maxie.
He’s the genius who gave us the talking Marcel Marceau statue. It was a sensation.
And D-CON is on its knees to sponsor the insect zoo…
…here in the old hardware store.
We can’t lose.
Lydia, you finally decided to join us.
Honey, I just, uh, finished the initial presentation.
And now I think it’s time to have a stretch…
…and to invite our friends to meet your friends, okay?
Are they here yet?
Charles, we’re here to see some ghosts.
They’re not here anymore.
Every time she says that, the paint peels…
…and, uh, some wild creature tries to kill us.
But we have these pictures, Lydia.
No, really. They said they might come back and we could all live here…
…if you agreed not to tease them or make them do stupid tricks.
She has such a tendency to overreact.
Don’t worry, we’re not relying on her. We have Otho.
Are they still here, Otho?
Otho, are they still here?
Oh, they’re still here. They’re just hiding out.
Probably feel guilty about what they did to me.
They’re sorry they didn’t kill you.
Well, I don’t know from guilt. I just wanna see them.
Otho, can you do it?
It’ll be tricky, but I think I can handle it.
No.
Wait. What am I worried about? Otho, you can’t even change a tire.
I’ll be needing something personal of theirs.
You’ll have to go to the Goodwill.
Excuse me.
The wedding clothes.
The words:
[CHANTING] Hands vermilion
Start of five
Bright cotillion
Raven’s dive
Nightshade’s promise
Spirits strive
To the living Let now the dead come alive
Barbara?
[CHANTING] As sudden thunder pierces night
As magic wonder mad affright
Rives asunder man’s delight
Our ghost, our corpse
And we rise to be
Oh, no.
[MOUTHS] Help.
Barbara?
Stop it.
Shh!
LYDIA: No.
OTHO: [CHANTING] As flies the lizard
Serpent fell
As goblin vizard at the spell
The buried, dead and slain rise again
[MOUTHS] Barbara?
What’s happening to them?
I don’t know.
They’re dying.
No, they’re not. They’re already dead. They can’t feel a thing.
That’s not true. Look at them.
CHARLES: All right, that’s enough now.
Can you stop this?
Otho.
It’s too late, Charles. I’m sorry.
Where are you? Help them, please.
Sure, I can help them. But you’ve gotta help me.
What?
Look, I’m what you call an illegal alien.
I want out for good. In order for me to do that, hey, I gotta get married.
Hey, these aren’t my rules. Come to think of it, I don’t have any rules.
Come on. Come on.
Think of it as a marriage of inconvenience. Okay? We both get something. I get out.
You get to say you’re hitched with the most eligible bachelor since Valentino.
We’re even, babe.
Okay, just help them.
Sure.
Betelgeuse.
It’s showtime.
Attention, Kmart shoppers.
[GASPS]
[LAUGHS]
Well, I’m back. I feel real good about myself. You know what I mean? So…
…without further delay…
…welcome to Winter River Museum of Natural Greed.
A monument to the bored businessman.
Come on, a little closer. Step right up. Test your strength.
[LAUGHS]
BETELGEUSE: Thank you.
Thank you.
That is why I won’t do two shows a night anymore, babe.
I won’t. I won’t do them.
Well, what have we got here tonight, kids?
Well, we’ve got the, uh, Maitlands.
I think they’ve had enough exercise for tonight.
Not so fast, Round Boy. We’re gonna have some laughs.
[CACKLES]
Otho.
[SCREAMS]
[BETELGEUSE CHUCKLES]
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah.
Mom, Dad:
I just want you two to know you’re welcome in our house…
…anytime you want to come over.
In the meantime, the dowry’s on me, Dad.
Well, the Maitlands are taken care of.
Everything seems to be pretty much back to normal, I think.
Shall we?
Called the caterer. He’s got a great band.
We’re gonna need witnesses. Would you?
[SCREAMING]
Come on. Let’s go. Let’s get on with the ceremony.
Do you, Betel…
Aah! Uh-uh!
Nobody says the “B” word. Come on.
PREACHER: Do you take this woman…
…to be your wedded wife?
Oh, jeez, I don’t know. I mean, it’s kind of a big decision.
I always said if I ever did it, I was gonna do it once and that was it.
Sure. Yeah. Go ahead.
And you, do you, Lydia, take this man…
No. Betel…
She’s a little bit nervous. Uh, maybe I should answer for her, okay?
[IN LYDIA’S VOICE] I’m Lydia and I’m of sound mind.
The man next to me is the one I want. You asked me. I’m answering.
Yes, I love that man of mine.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Come on.
PREACHER: Then by the…
Betel…
Come on. Come on.
Betelgeu…
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Scram.
Come on.
Take a hike.
PREACHER: May we continue with the ceremony?
[PREACHER CLEARS THROAT]
Then by…
Betelgeuse.
Betelgeuse.
Oh, gee.
Strike.
Come on, let’s get rolling now, rev.
Then by the authority vested in me…
The ring, please.
The ring. Oh, no.
Jewelry store. Here.
That’s not it.
You know I got it, honey.
[SANDWORM GROWLING]
Here it is. Here you go.
I’m telling you, honey, she meant nothing to me. Nothing at all.
I now pronounce you…
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Man and…
Ow!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
[SCREAMS]
[CHUCKLES]
GIRL: Bye. LYDIA: Bye.
Bye.
Bye, you guys.
Bye.
What time is it, honey?
It’s about 3:30, I guess.
Give or take a year.
Hello?
Well?
Did you get the paints?
Yes. And I took pictures of the new town hall for you too.
BARBARA: How’d you do on that Science test?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog.
I told them no way. I said it was against my religion. So I got a C.
And how about the Math test?
You have got to be kidding me. We spent the whole week studying for that test.
I got an A.
So can I?
Well, I don’t know. Got a C on the Science test.
Adam, don’t tease her. You never got on A in Science…
Come on.
Well…
…I suppose.
[HARRY BELAFONTE’S “JUMP IN THE LINE” PLAYING]
This thing reads like stereo instructions.
Sounds like Lydia got an A on the Math test. Jeez!
He likes it.
[SINGING “JUMP IN THE LINE” IN HARRY BELAFONTE’S VOICE]
Hey!
Sorry. Didn’t see you sitting there.
Women.
I don’t know what her problem is.
Normally, chicks…
[DINGS]
[SIGHS]
Pardon me. Did you do that?
That’s very nice work. Let me ask, how do you get them so sm…?
Hey, there goes Elvis. Yo, King.
Well, looks like I’m next.
Good thing too. I gotta do a photo shoot for GQ in about an hour and a half.
They’ve been after me for months. Doing some kind of underwear deal, I don’t know…
Hey, what are you doing? Stop it. You’re messing up my hair.
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] Come on! Whoa! Whoa! Stop it!
Whoa!
Hey, this might be a good look for me.

Terry?
Terry?
[groans]
Somebody close the curtain! Terry.
[distorted] You’ll be okay.
[sirens wailing in distance]
[distorted voices continue speaking]
Breathe.




[Terry inhales]
[trumpet playing]
Your playing’s getting better. I like that tune.
How’s the leg?
[chuckles]
Thanks.
I’ll take care of it.
I don’t care, Annie.
She can find her own way.
[Annie] It’s not fair.
How long is she gonna be here?[Annie] I don’t know.
She’s your guest, Annie, not mine.
She should pitch in at least.
I’ll take care of it.
You can’t keep covering for her.
Got a date.
Good luck.
[door opens]
[door closes] Ness is an ass.
I mean, she’s not wrong.
I’m not your problem to solve.
These came for you.
[sighs]
No, thanks.
I’ll land something soon.




Of course you will.
[choreographer] Ladies, this is a casting call for tap only.
If you’re here and you can’t tap, I don’t wanna know you.
[jaunty music playing]
Sixteen, no.
Twenty-nine, no.
Seventeen.
No.
[sighs]
[gasps, groans]
[casting director] Name?
Uh, Theresa Gionoffrio.
Uh, Terry for short.
[director] Do we know each other, Miss Gionoffrio?
Oh, no, no.
We never met, but, uh, I know who you are.
[chuckles] And you too, Mr. Marchand.
Uh, obviously.
She’s the girl who fell.
Ah, Kiss Me, Kate, of course. You’re, uh… You’re infamous.
“Infamous.” Huh.
Wow. [chuckles] I…
I prefer famous, but I’ll take what I can get.
Um… [clears throat] I… I have six years of formal training at Kearney Dance Academy.
That’s in Hazard, Nebraska.




I have three shows under my belt.
Did you say Hazard?
Yes. Yes, sir.
Um, my family, they run a slaughterhouse there.
What happened that night won’t happen again, sir.
All I need is a chance.
What move was it?
Um… [clears throat]
A jeté.
I, uh… I hit the split just right, but my toe came down too early.
I mean, I’ve done it a million times, but just that one…
Show me.
Okay.
[chuckles]
Again.
Okay.
[grunts]
Again.
Mm-hmm.
[director] Again.
Again.
Again.
Again. Again.
Again.
[grunts, groans]
Again.
[exhales shakily]
[gasps] Ah.
[director whispering]
[groaning]
Um, I can… I can do it all day if you want me to.
We’ll call you.
You know, I haven’t even sang yet.
Just… How about one song?
[door opens, closes]
What kind of animals did your family process in Hazard, Miss Gionoffrio?
Pigs, mostly.
And what were they like?
Uh, what were they like, sir?
Yeah, do they…
roll around in the mud?
Do they sniff at the dirt?
Wiggle their little tails?
Sure.
Well, show me.
Show you?
Get down on your hands.
Show me.
Sniff around in the mud, roll in the dirt
and wiggle your little tail.




[chuckles]
Um…
I’ll… I’ll do just about anything for another shot, Mr. Marchand.
But I won’t humiliate myself.
[Marchand] Good for you.
Hey, you have to take it easy on those pills, Terry.
Being onstage isn’t worth this.
Oh, Annie.
Of course it is.
How’d you do?
They asked me in for a callback.
Of course they did.
[director] Number five showed real promise.
Thirteen was a little sloppy, but I can get her there.
Hon, have you thought about going back to Nebraska?
Look, I wouldn’t want to go back to London either,
but just until you’re back on your feet.
I came here for one reason, Annie.
To dance.
To make something of myself.
To see my name in big lights.
That’s three reasons.
[chuckles]
[shuffling]
[door opens]
What?
What?
[door closes]
I know you. What are you planning?
What? Uh…
I’ll see you at home.
[saxophone playing]
[sighs]
Evening, ma’am.
Is there someone I can help you find?
Good evening, sir. I’m here for Alan Marchand.
Uh, please tell him that Terry Gionoffrio is here to see him.
Is Mr. Marchand expecting you?
Uh, yes. Yes, he… he is.
Um, yes.
Maybe I should call you a cab.
Oh, no, no. I’m… I’m fine.
I, uh… I’m here… [metal groaning]
Wh… What was that?
What was what?
Ma’am?
[echoing, distorting] What was what?
Whoa, Nelly.
You lost, honey?
Excuse me.




You think the poor thing’s all right?
Let’s get her up.
Come on, honey.
One, two, three and up we go.
[groans]
[sighs]
[clock ticking]
[door closes]
[couple conversing, faint]
[Terry] I’ll do just about anything, but I won’t humiliate myself.
[choreographer] Seventeen. No.
Girl who fell.
[Terry humming]
Wish me luck, Mama.
[person 1] Forget it.
[person 2] Forget it?
[gasps]
No, no, I agree.
I told you not to go.
What did you say to me?
What happened?
She seemed sharp as a tack.
No, she wasn’t sharp as a tack.
Honey, hurry. I wanna read the paper too.
Look at this headline.
What’s going on in this world now?
I’d like to know.
Oh.
Oh, good morning, dear. How’d you sleep?
She needs coffee. You need coffee.
Sit down. Sit down.
You look terrible.
Make it a Bloody Mary, Roman.
What’s your name, dear?
Terry Gionoffrio.
Oh, I won’t ask you to spell that.
[chuckles] I’m Minnie. And this is my hubby, Roman.
Oh, uh, pleased to meet you. Thank you. [chuckles]
Drink up. I have one of these every morning.
One. Ha.
Sit down, will you? You’re giving me a neck ache.
Eat. Eat. Roman made enough for an army.
[chuckles]
Uh, I don’t eat meat, but thank you.
What do you mean, you don’t eat meat?
What are you? You a Hindu?
Uh, no. I grew up on a pig farm.
It’s kind of hard to enjoy the smell of bacon when you’ve seen how it’s made.
Huh.
Um… [clears throat] I’m sorry. I’m a little hazy on last night.
We found you on the sidewalk.
Like some junkie. You’re not a junkie, are you?
Oh, no, no, it’s just… I told you.
You mentioned you were a friend of Alan’s.
Not so much a friend as a prospective employee.
For his Broadway show.
You know, I… I’m a dancer, and I was just hoping that…
You’d waltz in there and show him it wouldn’t be a show without you.
[chuckles]
Well, something like that.
I was in really bad shape last night,
and there aren’t a whole lot of people in the world who’d help out a stranger like that.
Oh.
Oh, go on, will you.
What sense is a guest room without a guest to stick in there?
[chuckles]
I knew you was a performer, you know, as soon as I saw you.
[chuckles] Did my leotard give me away?
Nah, you got an interesting inner quality.
It’s a star quality, in fact.
Stop it. [chuckles]
I’m not one to yank chains, honey.
So what happened to the leg?
Oh. Uh…
I had an accident four months ago,
which is a shame because most dancers have two feet, not one.
You want some free advice?
It’s not our falls that define us.
It’s what we do afterwards.
Put that down. I want to show you something.
Come on.
[Roman] We bought this place as an investment.
[Minnie] We say we bought the place as an investment,
but the truth is we wanted to choose our neighbors.
[Roman chuckles] So what do you think?
Uh, it’s nice. It’s great.
Really.
The high ceilings and that view.
[chuckles]
Oh, that thing’s an eyesore.
Yeah, yeah. Roman, take a pill.
Well.
Anyway, Minnie and I were talking this morning…
The place is yours if you want it.
Mmm.
Oh, uh…
I appreciate the offer,
but I could never afford the rent on a place like this.
Oh, we wouldn’t be charging you.
We didn’t have kids of our own,
which means we’ve got a hell of a lot of money
and no one to spend it on.
[Roman] The young woman who was here before
was running away from an abusive boyfriend.
We helped her find her confidence.
We enjoy helping people.
[Minnie] Scores us points with the man upstairs.
Now, now.[laughs]
We’re not saying it would be forever.
[Minnie] Just until you get back on your feet.
Who knows? You might run into Alan one of these days.
The neighbors here are awfully friendly.
Uh… [chuckles]
Would you pass me that sweater?
No.
I refuse to be an accomplice. Terry, you don’t even know these people.
Look, they’re just lonely old people looking for someone to rescue,
and I am happy to play damsel in distress if it means…
[British accent] …living at the Bramford.[chuckles]
That would suit you, you know.
[Annie] Mm-hmm. Do you think my landlord would go for that excuse?
[imitating Annie] Oh, I’m sorry, I can’t make this month’s rent.
I just looked too damn good in this silk scarf.
[laughs]
Why do I sound so posh?
I couldn’t resist!
Okay. I can’t leech off of you forever, Annie.
Moving into my own place feels like a first step, and this is meant to be.
Afternoon, Miss Gionoffrio.
Hi.
I’ll take that.
Oh, thank you.
Welcome to the Bramford.
[door opens]
[sighs]
[knocking]
[chuckles] Mrs. Castevet, hi.
No, it’s Minnie, dear.
Mrs. Castevet makes me sound like an old crone.
I brought you a little housewarming gift.
Oh.
It needs plenty of light.
Thank you.
Yeah.
What you got there?
Oh, um… I think this belonged to your old tenant, Joan. Right?
Oh.
It’s fitting, really.
She skipped out of here like Cinderella at midnight.
It’s a shame.
You know, she was a gifted young woman.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Are you free for drinks tonight around 9:00?
Uh, yeah. Sure. What should I bring over?
Oh, it won’t be at our place.
Mr. Marchand, hi.
[chuckles] Mr. Marchand, hi.
Mr. Marchand, hi. [chuckles]
[gasps] Ow.
[buzzes]
[clears throat]
Ah, Theresa.
Uh, Mr. Marchand, hi.
Yeah. Come in. Come. Come, come.
What will you have?
Um, how about an old-fashioned?
Good choice. Good choice.
I’m guessing the Castevets are the fashionably late type.
Wait. Wait, Minnie didn’t tell you?
Ah, of course she didn’t.
The Castevets send their apologies.
Apparently they double-booked this evening.
Apparently. [chuckles]
Listen, if you’d rather pick this up some other time, I totally understand.
Oh, no, no, no.
It’s…
This is perfect.
All right. Good.
Please take a seat.
So, uh… [clears throat]
…exactly how hard did Minnie have to twist your arm to get me up here?
Uh… [chuckles]
[chuckles] Well, actually, it was Roman.
Yeah, you do not say no to a patron of the arts,
especially one with such deep pockets.
[chuckles]
Well, truth be told, that’s not actually why I agreed.
Oh.
Really? Why’d you agree?
I was curious.
Last time we met you were the girl who fell,
and now you live on the floor below.
I gotta say, I did not peg you for such a fighter.
Well, it’s not our falls that define us, Mr. Marchand,
but what we do afterwards.
[chuckles]
Well, cheers.
Cheers.
[Marchand] You know, it’s considered one of the first Broadway musicals,
a seminal work by Adrian Marcato.
Of course, ours will be a contemporary take,
but there’s plenty about this dusty old show that is,
as you say in Kansas, right, just ain’t broke.
Nebraska.
Right.
This revival is, uh…
Well, it’s a tribute to Marcato’s legacy.
You know, a heartfelt homage, really.
Oh, wow. That sounds really interesting.
Well, there’s been a considerable amount of financial
and emotional investment,
which is why I know you understand that I need the best.
Yeah, only the most devoted.
Well, if you’d be willing to let me audition again…
Why dance?
Dancing is my joy. It’s…
It’s the one thing you’ve always dreamed of. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You and a million other girls. No, I want to know what drives you.
I want to know what fuels you.
Um… [clears throat]
My mother died when I was young.
There was an accident on the farm.
It was sudden.
And, um, when my dad fell to pieces…
dancing was my escape.
All I had to do was
move my body a certain way and…
and everything bad in the world would disappear.
It’s the only time I felt like I had control over my life.
I’d do anything to chase that feeling.
No.
Not anything.
[scoffs]
What, you want me to oink for you now, Mr. Marchand?
Crawl around on your floor and wiggle my little tail?
I got you.
Oh, come on. Let’s make a toast.
To body and soul.
To body and soul.
[Marchand, echoing] Are you all right?
I don’t feel that well.
[glass drops to floor][sighs]
Whoa. [chuckling]
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You really can’t handle your liquor, can you, sweetheart?
Oh.
[distorted] All right?
Yeah, I just… I don’t…
I don’t feel that well.

Here.
Look, I, uh… I had a wonderful time last night.
[chuckles]
Really?
I don’t remember a whole lot.
Okay, well, I’ll try not to take that personally. [chuckles]
No, I just… I don’t, you know, usually…
Relax. I understand. I do.
You know, last night was a one-off.
Right?
Right.
Well, you should eat up. You’ve got a big day today.
What’s today?
Wow, you really don’t remember much, do you?
You made the chorus, sweetheart.
You’re in.

The girl who fell.
Uh, it’s Terry, actually.
You’re dragging your step.
Well, I’m a couple of days behind the rest of you, but I’ll catch up.
[chuckles] Uh, look,
if you’re gonna sleep your way into the show,
at least have the talent to back it up.
Hmm.
[door opens]
[dancers chattering, laughing]
[door opens]
I thought that was you.
Come on in here a minute.
Oh, no, it’s been a long day, Minnie.
[sighs]
Terry, darling, meet Lily Gardenia.
She’s next door to you in 7E.
Hello, Terry.
[chuckles] It’s nice meeting you, Mrs. Gardenia.
[Minnie] Sit, sit.
Lily here, she was the first lady judge in New York State.
“Lady judge” wasn’t my official title.
I got tired of watching you limp around like a cripple,
so I told Lily here about your little… [clicks tongue] …problem.
Really, Minnie.
You make it sound like she has a venereal disease.
Get out your peg. Let her take a look.
[stammers] Really?
Chop-chop, little onion.
[chuckles]
Oh.
What is it?
Peppermint. Rosemary.
One or two odds and ends.
I grow it all myself.
Twice a day should do the trick.
I can always whip up another batch.
Oh, thank you. That’s…
You’ll be flying in no time.

[choreographer] Six, seven, eight.

Up!
And drop.
[clapping]
Been doing your homework, Gionoffrio.
Good. All right.
[dancers chattering, laughing]
[chattering, faint]
You okay?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
A pittance for your blood, sweat and tears, kids.
Here it is, your first paychecks.
There you go. That’s it.
And remember, don’t spend it all in one place.
[“Jingle Bells” playing]
[guests chattering, laughing]
[gasps] Wow, look at that.
Oh, there are my girls. Are you having a ball yet?
The moment we stepped in. [chuckles]
Thanks again for letting me tag along, Mrs. Castevet.
No, it’s Minnie, dear. What are you supposed to be?
Come on. I want to introduce you to friends.
So, what’s it gonna take to get an introduction?
Yeah, yeah.
Meet Laura-Louise and Dan McBurney from 4F.
Wow, that’s quite a costume. Do you charge for calls?
And this is the wonderful Dr. Sapirstein.
You must be the famous Terry.
Well, not so famous yet, but give me a few more years. [chuckles]
This is my friend… Do you come from a big family, Terry?
Uh, no, not really. Just one brother.
Lots of cousins in Colorado though.[whispering]
[Sapirstein] Is that right?
Well, if you settle down, and you find yourself
in need of an obstetrician, you let me know.
Oh. [chuckles]
I don’t think that’ll be happening anytime soon.
All the same, you take my card.
Oh, well, thanks.
Uh, excuse me.
[Lily] I can’t do it. Not again.
Not another one.
[Minnie] Don’t start that again.
You know what’ll happen if you do.
[Lily] Is that a threat?
Oh, don’t be so dramatic.
Terry, darling!
I was just about to fix a vodka blush. You want one?
Oh, no, thanks.
Hey, Roman.
Grab the thing and get your big head in here.
Are you and Mrs. Gardenia okay?
Oh, just ignore us.
We’re a couple of bickering old maids. That’s all.
Merry Christmas, Terry, from the both of us.
Is this for me?[Roman] Mm-hmm.
Come on. While we’re still young.
[chuckles]
[chuckles] I…
I… I don’t know what to say.
How about a thank you?
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you.
Well, try it on.
[Minnie] Oh?[chuckles]
Oh, perfect.
Yeah?
I love it.
Look in the right pocket.
[Roman] It’s over 300 years old.
The green inside is tannis root.
[Minnie] It’s for good luck.
What’s the matter?
You’re acting like it’s the first time anybody gave you a gift.
I feel very lucky.
Jealous.

Are you gonna tell him?

What do you want?
It’d be the end of everything I’ve been working towards.
So…
[sniffles, sobs]
My cousin got one last year.
I can ask her if you’re sure.
I hear drinking bleach works a treat.
That was private, Vera.
Sorry.
You could always get someone to push you down a flight of stairs.
Terry, stop![Vera] Ow!

Looks like you made your problem go away, huh, Terry?
Yeah. If only your mother had the same foresight.
Oh.
Wow.
[laughs]
I suppose you think it’s funny, damaging company property.
Well, why don’t you make yourself useful
and help Terry clean up this mess? Go on.
[bells ring]
All right, everyone at the stage. Tech week is officially behind schedule.
Give me that.
You didn’t have to do that.
I can handle her.
Oh, I know you can.
But, uh, you’ve got enough to worry about…
and prepare for.
You know?
Well, you know, good news travels fast.
You think this is good news?
It’s unexpected news.
But it’s hardly the end of the world.
No.
No, it’s just the end of my career.
You know…
one day
everyone is gonna see what you’re capable of, Theresa.
And when that day comes,
people like Vera,
they’re not gonna stand a chance.
But until then,
I need you sharp onstage
and, uh, preferably yolk-free.
[chuckles]
[clears throat]
[silverware clinking]
Here she is, the lady of the hour.
Oh, look at her glowing already.
How’d you get in here?
The spare key.
We didn’t think you’d mind.
That Sapirstein sure has a big mouth.
Oh, don’t be sore at him.
He couldn’t contain himself.
He was like a kid at Christmas, wasn’t he, Roman?
Well, it wasn’t his place.
And it wasn’t your place to tell Mr. Marchand either.
So we told Alan. So what?
Terry, sweetheart, we know you’re scared being a single woman and all.
But we want to help. Anything you need.
Yeah. First thing tomorrow, we’ll go see Dr. Sapirstein together.
No, I haven’t decided if I’m gonna keep it.
The poor thing’s in shock.
No, I’m not in shock, Minnie.
I just worked too hard to get where I’m at to just throw it all away.
So, what are we talking here?
I can’t exactly raise a kid.
What the hell are you talking about?
You’d make a wonderful mother.
And besides, you’ve got plenty of family around to help.
You’re not my family.
Come with us.
Minnie, can you just leave, please? Both of you.
We just want to show you something.
Then we’ll let you be in your apartment.
We tried for years.
Decades, more like.
Why are you showing me this?
If there really is no room in your life for this baby, well…
We’ll make room in ours.
This is a lot.
I’m gonna need some time.
Look, all we’re saying is
you could give the kid up to some stranger you don’t know from a bar of soap
or you could give it up to us.
[Roman] You’d be giving us a great gift.
In return, we’d give you anything you want.
Yeah, anything in the world.
All I want is to work, to be onstage.
Don’t be so modest. Are you hearing this?
There must be more, Terry.
Forget the chorus line. You’re wasted there.
I know what you want.
You want your name up in big, flashy lights
on a big marquee.
The Pale Crook starring Terry Gionoffrio.
Terry, show biz is about relationships.
Let us take care of things.
What do you say?
Mmm.
There.
It’s settled.
[whimpers]
[metal clanking][voices whispering]
[chanting]
[chanting continues]
[gasps]
[creaking, thumping]
[Terry] Hello.
Is someone there?
[gasps]
[sighs]
Mrs. Gardenia.
You scared me.
I didn’t want it to come to this.
You, uh… You must have wandered out of your apartment.
I have to stop it.
I’m sorry.
[grunting][screaming]
No! No!
[thumping]
Open up!
[breathing heavily]
[Lily screams][panting]

[Lily groans][thuds]

[wheezes]
Mrs. Gardenia.
[knocking]
[sighs]
[clears throat]
Oh, my God. You look terrible.
Well, I didn’t get much sleep.
How’s Mrs. Gardenia?
Comatose.
Oh, my God.
Well, in the grand scheme of things, it’s better than dead.
You got any sugar, dear?
Uh, yeah, I think so.
Don’t bother. I’ll help myself.
You know, most likely you saved that woman’s life last night, Terry.
We’re proud of you.
Something was wrong with her. She chased me around the apartment.
I’m not even sure how she got in here.
Must have left the door unlocked.
[Minnie] You can take the girl out of Nebraska,
but you can’t take Nebraska out of the girl.
Poor old bat was losing her marbles.
We should be going. Thanks for the sugar.
We’ll keep you updated.
But in the meantime, you get some rest.
[door closes]
[crunches]
[grunts]
[radio playing, indistinct]
[radio continues playing, louder]
[reporter on radio] It was the most widespread,
most destructive racial violence in American history.
White people driving through the riot area were considered fair game,
whether young or old, men or women.
And the cars were burned.
The mobs might groan and curse in disappointment when a white got away.
[clicks]
[clattering, scraping]
[choreographer] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
One, two, three, strong. Five, six, seven, eight.
[director] And stop.
Find your mark, Vera.
What, here?
Oh.
Here.
[technician] I can adjust to you, Miss Clarke. That’s fine.
Oh, what can I say? The spotlight always finds me.
[dancers chuckle]
Ooh.
You pull something?
Yeah, my leg just feels a…
Ah.
Oh! [sobs]
Something doesn’t feel r-right.
[bones crunching][groaning]
For God’s sake. Somebody call a doctor.
She’s having a fit. Come on!
[dancer] Somebody do something! Leo!
[groaning]
[Marchand] Well, fortunately, it seems Vera is in a stable condition,
but, as we all know, opening night is in a matter of days.
So Leo and I have decided upon a replacement.
Gionoffrio.
The part is yours.
If you want it.
I-I want it.
You didn’t have to go through all this trouble.
If you’re gonna be the star of the show,
then you gotta look the part.
Show me that photo again.
Yeah.
Now, she had a face for short hair.
They’re saying she might never walk again.
Is that right?
Yeah, I don’t…
I don’t know. It just…
It just feels strange, the timing.
Well, who’s got time for sensitivity, huh?
I thought you’d be over the moon.
What? No, I am.
Well, it doesn’t sound like it.
I-I am. I am really.
Um, it’s just, whatever you said to Alan worked like a charm.
Maybe I shouldn’t have bothered.
I didn’t mean anything by it.
You had every single thing you ever wanted handed to you on a silver platter.
This is your big break. This is a role of a lifetime.
[gasps]
Ow.
You’re right.
I’m always right.

[receptionist] City Clinic.
Yes, um… [clears throat] Hi. Uh, this is Terry Gionoffrio.
I need to speak to Dr. Sapirstein, please.
I’m sorry. He’s busy. It’s urgent.
One moment.
[Sapirstein] This is Dr. Sapirstein.
Yes. Um, hi. There’s… There’s something wrong.
I-I’m sure of it.
I’m having these… these blinding pains.
Well, it’s perfectly normal for expectant mothers
to feel that way in the first trimester.
Right, um,
I-I-I’m seeing things that aren’t there.
Uh, is that normal too? Well, it can be.
No two pregnancies are ever alike.
You’re not listening to me.
I-I-I’m telling you there’s something wrong with the baby or me.
I don’t… I don’t know, but I can feel it. Something’s not right.
Why don’t you come into the office and I’ll examine you?
I’ll ask Minnie to pack you a bag.
No, no. Don’t… Don’t call Minnie.
And… [clears throat] I’m sorry, what do I need a bag for? [chuckles]
It may be necessary to admit you to the hospital.
There’s a condition known as perinatal hysteria.
Oh, I’m…
No, no, no. I’m not… I’m not crazy.
If you could be a danger to yourself or the baby,
then measures must be taken.
[knocking]
[keys jingling]
[Minnie] Oh!
What’s the holdup, dear? You got company?
No. Did you… Did you need anything?
Oh, Roman and I made too much jiffy ground.
Oh, uh, thanks, but I-I’m not hungry.
Well, good night.
[exhales]
[exhales shakily]
[Minnie] Roman, come on!
[Roman] Go right now?
[Minnie] Come on. Your staff has waited long enough.
[bell dings]
[stagehand] Joan Cebulski?
Look, all I know is she said she’d be back for her things in a day.
And that was six months ago.
Her things?
I was this close to donating it to Goodwill.
[sizzles] Ah!
[bell tolling]
[grunts, inhales]
[gasps]
[groans]
Dear Father, I’m not… really the praying kind.
[gasps] Are you all right, dear?
Sister, please.
I need to know what’s happening to me.
Where did you get that book?
Uh, it belonged to someone at the Bramford.
Stay away from it.
For generations, rumors have persisted
about a congregation of Satan worshippers that made the Bramford home.
That book is their scripture.
I think they did something to her.
Her name was Joan Cebulski.
She lived in the apartment before me.
She’d come here to repent, but it wasn’t she who needed to repent.
They did terrible things to her, ungodly things.
She fled in the middle of the night.
She was hit by a bus.
The paper said she’d lost her mind,
but there were eyewitnesses who swore they’d seen somebody chasing her.
What did they want with her?
Just before the turn of the century,
the leader of their coven claimed to have conjured the devil himself.
He left a son and heir.
He will stop at nothing.
[inhales sharply]
No.
[groans, clears throat]
They chose you.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done… Sister. Sister.
If this child is born,
God have mercy on us all.
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
[tools scraping][gasps]
[speaking Cantonese] She needs to relax.
You doing okay?
Mm-hmm.
Fine.
[metal clattering, scraping]
[gasps]
[heartbeat thumping]
[screams]
I’m sorry. Did I hurt you?
What’s happening?
[Annie speaking Cantonese] Are you okay?
[gasping]
Terry. Terry!
Terry, Terry! Wait, Terry, wait. Wait!
[sobbing]
It’s all my… It’s all my fault.
[stammering] It was just so much pain.
It was like I just pushed it on to her.
Whatever that was, it had nothing to do with you.
No. Look what happened to Vera.
Vera?
The amount of times that I… I fantasized
about something terrible happening to her just because I wanted her part.
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down. Breathe.
Breathe.
You couldn’t have done this. It is impossible.
Yeah. You’re right. Yeah.
You’re right, Annie.
It’s not me, it’s them.
It’s them.
This is so much bigger than me.
[stammering] They did something.
They did something to that woman,
to Vera, to Mrs. Gardenia… and she was one of them.
Terry, you’re scaring me.
The way that that nun looked at me, she knew.
It’s too late, okay?
This thing, it’s just… There’s something wrong with it.
It’s, like, a part of me and I can’t run from this, okay?
Talk to me. Whatever it is, we’ll figure it out.
We’ll leave.
No, no.
I have to face this on my own.
Okay.
Terry…
Evening, Terry.
Everything all right?
[bell dings]
Minnie?
[elevator rumbles]
[voices chanting]
[wood creaks]
Alan, what the hell is this place?
You really don’t remember?
[chanting]
There were so many tries before you.
But you,
you were different.
You’re sick.
You violated me.
You practically begged for it.
[gasping]
Don’t touch me.
Oh, you really are a marvel.
[sniffles]
Do you want me to suffer?
Yes.
Please.
Please, don’t touch me. Don’t touch me.
You know you crave the spotlight,
but really…
you’ve always belonged in the dark.
The girl who fell no more.
Stop!
Do you feel powerful?

Oh!
Looks like you’ve been busy.
[door closes]
Roman, get in here.
Terry.
My goodness.
I know what you did to me.
Why don’t you sit down?
I know about Joan.
I know what you are.
[Minnie] So what?
So, I won’t be a part of it.
No, that’s not how it works, girlie.
You remember how you were when we found you?
You know, you were kind of a mess.
I hate to say it, but you were nothing.
We have given you everything.
Everything isn’t worth this.
We have a deal.
Mmm.
Deal’s off.
It’s a little lower, honey.
[shouts, panting]
[groans]
[sobs]
[screaming]
Aw, baby doesn’t like that.
Baby’s here to stay.
Get away!
You’re evil.
Why?
Because I pray to a different god than you?
Let me tell you, when I was just a boy,
my father was violently attacked by a righteous, God-fearing mob,
beaten to within an inch of his life right in front of my eyes.
Why? Because they were scared of him.
Because he had harnessed a dark power
and it was mesmerizing.
You’re the heir.
Conjuring the devil was just the beginning.
We needed a human vessel.
A carrier.
For what?
His son.
[Minnie] Let me ask you.
You don’t actually think that Alan was the father, do you?
Our lord chose you. Your son will change the world.
All will be forgiven. We’re your family now.
[Roman] You’re not alone anymore, sweetheart.
And I can’t wait to watch the world discover what a treasure you are.
I could have made it on my own.
I know.
This is a role that you were born to play.
[Roman] He looked inside of you and saw your strength,
the depth of your ambition.
He will redeem the despised
and wreak vengeance in the name of the burned and the tortured.
He will live.
Every soul on this earth will know your name.
My friends,
God is dead.
Satan lives.
The year is one!
[all] The year is one!
Hail Terry, mother of our lord.
[all] Hail Terry.
Hail Satan!
Hail Satan!
[scoffs]
Hail Satan.
[all] Hail Satan.
Hail Satan!
Hail Satan!

FUNDI: Cesar gained to his side history’s richest man, his uncle, Crassus, who was here to support Cesar’s vision of New Rome, which was displeasing to Mayor Cicero,
Cesar’s bitter rival.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
Hello, gentlemen.
Welcome. Good to see you.
(ALL CHEERING)
MAYOR CICERO: Good to see you all.
Here we are, waiting above this model of the city, over the Design Authority’s newly demolished site, which everyone is now claiming as their own.
NEWSMAN: Hey, Mr. Crassus, over here!
Hey, Mr. Crassus! Over here.
Let me ask you a real question, okay?
CRASSUS: Turn the cameras off. Let’s have some fun.
Fuck the cards. What is it like being rich?
What’s it like?
Yeah.
Well, you can scare people.
You like to scare people?
Sleighboy, Strayboy, Playboy…

A fun casino, the latest in electronic gaming.
And no construction delays of any kind, or trouble from the unions or the waterfront, thanks to the Mayor.

Aw, come on.
Come on! No?

“To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them. To die, to sleep no more… and by a sleep to say we end the heartache, and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep… To sleep, perchance to dream, ay, there’s the rub: For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause.”

As Chairman of the Design Authority, my jurisdiction covers parks and fairs…
Please don’t take a picture of that.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)
Thank you.
Come out with me.
I can’t. I’m sorry.
Why?
My jurisdiction covers parks and fairs, and we’ve already issued the necessary bonds to develop this site.
The Mayor’s show for the honchos has become a battle for their attention, especially with Cesar Catilina, whom I am acquainted, denying my requests for a comment.
I cleared this site to create something to inspire people.
MAYOR CICERO: People? Oh, wha…
When have you ever even cared about people, Catilina?
CESAR: Here is my plan: a city that people can dream about.
MAYOR CICERO: People don’t need dreams. They need teachers, sanitation, jobs.
The “need” is to create something that lives on after a City Fair, Mayor.
Which is why Megalopolis will be built entirely out of the Megalon, which is imperishable.
NUSH: The Megalon is unsafe!
Concrete, concrete, concrete, and steel, steel, steel is safe!
Imagine today’s society a branch of civilization about to reach a dead-end…
Humanity as an old tree with one misguided branch called “civilization…”
(PENCIL CLATTERS)
…going nowhere.
I like trees as much as the next guy,
but we’re not here to discuss trees.
People need help, and they need it now!
No. Don’t let the now destroy the forever.
We are talking about people.
People, Catilina,
and how they live now.
CESAR: No time to talk of people’s future?
Yet there’s always time to convince them
to use money they don’t have,
to buy things they don’t need,
to imitate people they don’t like.
Which makes you the chief slumlord
and the Mayor of the city of nothing.




You call me that again, and I will smash your face.
Easy, gentlemen.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Were you so cool and collected
when you poisoned your wife and her body disappeared?
Is Megalon, your miracle method,
made from her body?
Is your poor Sunny Hope a plastic girder somewhere?
A wall panel?
What really happened?
Well, you were the prosecuting D.A.,
so you know I was acquitted.
And you’re still a slumlord.
I am not a slumlord!
You will not stand here
and call me a slumlord.
No, no, no.
MAYOR CICERO: No. No, no, I am not a slumlord!
Stop. I’m…
You will never call me that!
HART: Easy. Easy, Frank, calm down!
No! No!
Hold him.
I’m so sorry.
MAYOR CICERO: Is that what we’re playing?
Three-year-old games.
Thank you.
WOW: Hit it, Jerry!

I sent a letter to you last night.
A, uh, childish letter,
and I want it back before you read it.
CESAR: Childish…
JULIA: No.
That one.
Uh-huh.
May I have it, please?
Unfortunately, I have already read it.
And yes, it was childish.
I had help, and we weren’t in our right minds.
But witty, I’d say, in a cruel and insulting way.
Well, I think the way you treat the mayor
is cruel and insulting.
Defending your father is admirable, Julia Cicero,
as delinquent as usual.
(JULIA SIGHS)
I’m turning over a new leaf, don’t mess with me.
CESAR: I’m not messing,
you’re the one who came in disguise.
I finished a year of medical school.
One year of medical school. Were you kicked out?
I was not. I dropped out.
I wonder why.
(JULIA SIGHS)
I guess you could say my love of science
bumped up against a brick wall of…
intellectual vigor
on the subject of jellyfish.
Mm.
Their mesoglea material
is a flexible skeleton, unique…
until encountering something higher, almost spiritual…
like the Megalon.
Look, a real Nobel Prize.
Expired?
Nobel Prizes don’t expire.
I meant your medication.
What I’m curious about is the Mayor’s take
on your absurd behavior.
You ask my father about people living as I do,
and he’s shocked.
What’s shocking about you?
I want to be the Statue of Liberty!
I see.
The gossip columns say that you…
You read gossip columns.
Whatever for?
To waste time.
You have so much of it you can waste it?
Sometime.
Hmm.
Oh, dear.
Lots of empty bottles.

where you said,
“In order to understand time, consciousness, courage,
“you must identify it in yourself.”

You really must have been a rude and spoiled child.
As you are now?
So, do you still have your med school microscope?
No, I sold it when I dropped out,
to buy drugs.
Psilocybin, of course.
And who supports your lifestyle now,
Daddy?
I hope I didn’t ruin your breakfast.
(LAUGHING) Come back.
What for?
Well, for laughs, of course.
What else did you come here for?
I was trying to be a go-between.
CESAR: Oh. You want to help me.
JULIA: Yeah. And, well, I…
Well, I want to learn.
And you think one year of medical school
entitles you to plow through the riches
of my Emersonian mind?
Entitles me?
Yes.
(SCOFFS)
Entitles me?
Yes.
Entitles me?
Yes.
You have no idea about me.
You think I’m nothing, just a socialite…
CESAR: No, not nothing,
but I reserve my time for people who can think.
About science and literature and architecture and art.
You find me cruel, selfish and unfeeling? I am.
I work without caring what happens to either of us.
So go back to the club, “bare it all,”
and stalk the kind of people that you enjoy.
Fine. I will!
CESAR: Come back when you have more time.
JULIA: Yes.
I saw you change the laws of physics.
Could it be the great Cesar Catilina
doesn’t obey anything, not even T-symmetry?
What did you see?
I was hoping you’d tell me.

That old fool Nush tried to muscle you out of politics.
(RUMBLING)
(SCREAMS)
Yeah, well, he dropped dead, and I won.
Don’t you see what we built?
This is the dream, the unwanted,
the unneeded, the uneducated,
we’re all together now. Power to the people.
Power to the people!
CROWD: Power to the people!
Pulcher for the culture!
CROWD: Pulcher for the culture!
Cesar’s not a pleaser!
CROWD: Cesar’s not a pleaser!
Pulcher for Alderman, it’s only me, no one else!
You can’t name anyone else!
It’s just…
MAN: Cesar Catilina!
Who said that?
MAN: Cesar Catilina!
You shut the fuck up!
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)
Will no one rid me of this fucking cousin?
Will no one rid me of this fucking cousin?
Stop. Go film them.
Fuck Cesar!
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)
(DOOR OPENS)
Catilina.
This is an unexpected visit, Cicero.
Call me Frank.
It’s not Franklyn, but really Frank.
You know, like Sinatra, Francis.
Francis. Is this Design Authority business?
(SIGHS)
There’s something I need to say.
It’s difficult.
May I?
Sure. Go on.
Please. I know I’ve attacked you,
prosecuted you,
but you can’t begin to know what Julia means to me.
Oh.
I’ll give up everything.
Please, pass her by.
We both know what’s best for her and the child.
Let Julia go. Think of her.
If you could make her feel you no longer love her…
I would put this in your hands.
It’s my signed confession.
Evidence about your wife’s body.
Now that Nush Berman is dead, I can say it.
I was dishonest in my prosecution of you.
Now, I can survive anything,
just not her
to know my complicity.
This is your insurance policy.
Although I don’t understand what you’re doing,
I will support you.
Privately
and publicly.
If you can do this for my family,
we will always be grateful.
I’ll wait three days to hear from you.
Oh, Cicero.
There are only two things
impossible to stare at very long,
the sun
and your own soul.
Wow, where’s your coat?
I waited with no coat
because I knew you’d give me yours.
And it would be warm.
(SNIFFS) Oh. Oh.
It smells of you.
Sandalwood… citrus…
sweet male memories.
It can still all be yours, Cesar,
me and Crassus’s bank,
which I’ll steal so I can give it to you.
Wow.
(ENGINE STARTS)
WOW: I should really learn more about banking, dear.
I’m so bored all day.
CRASSUS: That’s no good.
And you want me to, right, darling?
CRASSUS: Oh.
You want me to take over?
CRASSUS: Yes.
Yes.
I’ll start with Cesar’s accounts.
HOST: Tonight on Crosstalk.
HOSTESS: Is Megalon the path to a better life
for you and your family?
Or is it the dream of an eccentric
mad scientist that could kill us all?
HOST: On Crosstalk.
MAN 1: Megalon is from outer space.
MAN 2: Open your window, man,
look at what’s happening in the streets.
The new revolution, man! Sex, drugs, and Megalon!
“Megalopolis Doesn’t Fit Together!”
“Megalon Deemed Unsafe by Experts.”
FUNDI: What are you doing?
What bullshit.
FUNDI: What are you doing?
You can’t park here.
This is a construction site.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
You can’t park here. Look!
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
FUNDI: (IN ENGLISH) You don’t…
Oh, you don’t understand. Okay.
Okay. Okay.
You got it.
I have to get home soon to make dinner.
FUNDI: You have to move. You have to move.
I’m just going to go say hi.
FUNDI: I’ll deal with this guy.
You, get in your car, you don’t understand me?
Move! I said, get in your car and move it. Let’s go.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
FUNDI: Let’s go. Let’s go!
Get in. Let’s go!
The mayor’s waiting.
FUNDI: Let’s go. Let’s go!
Can I have your autograph?
CESAR: Of course you can.
What’s your name?
Sam.
Sam. I love that name Sam, it’s to the point.
Cesar will never say no to a child.
“To Sam…” How old are you, Sam?
I’m 12.
Twelve. I used to be 12,
you believe it or not.
Do I look 12 now?
No.
Thank you, Sam. (CHUCKLING)
All right, there you are, Sam. (TAPS PEN)
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
(BULLET CLINKING)
JULIA: No!
Boss!
JULIA: Hey! Hey, stop!
Help him!
(SIREN WAILING)
(FUNDI MUTTERING)
Come on.
CESAR: I will not let time
have dominion over my thoughts.
…have dominion over my thoughts.
(SHOUTS) I will not let time
have dominion
over my thoughts!
(GUNSHOT)
I will not let time
have dominion over my thoughts.
I will not let time have…
I will not let time have dominion… my thoughts.
…let time… I will not let time
have dominion over my thoughts.
…my thoughts…
I will not let time have dominion over my thoughts.
Time, stop! (ECHOES)
JULIA: I’m here, my love. I’m here, my love.
DR. LYRA: Megalon has no delineation,
knows no boundaries… (ECHOING)
Megalon will activate some of the signals
that will express genes,
sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, human connection…
JULIA: Cesar.
Megalon fuses all forces…
…will activate some of the signals
that will express genes…
…enabling Cesar to grow his face like a second skin.
Do you have the cells?
It is a language.
Sunny’s hair.
CHARLES: We found a sample of Sunny’s hair.
DR. LYRA: The first of its kind bio-hybrid.
A living material combining man-made
and nature-grown tissues.
The Megalon is the connection, the signal.
You think this is a joke?
You’ve made him a martyr, you fucking idiot.
It’s bad enough he won the Nobel,
now you’ve made him a martyr.
You’re an ignoramus.
Sic semper tyrannis!
(CLODIO GRUNTS)
(CESAR MOANING IN PAIN)
Sunny…
JULIA: I’m here, honey.
I was desperate.
(SHUSHES) It’s okay.
I discovered the principle of Megalon
trying to save her life.
(WATER SPLASHING)
The red envelope…
Cicero.
Something never disclosed.
The embodiment of all my desires and regrets
were named Jane Doe.
My mania,
my obsessions,
my greatest loss,
Jane Doe.
Condemned with the truth.
Truths, found in the coldest, darkest morgue of our heart.
(WHISPERING) Be with her.
CESAR: She came home with good news,
but saw something that enraged her jealousy.
I followed, but I saw her drive over the bridge,
and into the icy water.
And in that madness, it came to me.
I discovered the principle of Megalon
trying to save her life.
She said she had good news… (ECHOES)
her secret.
And then all was lost to me forever.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
This is my heart.
(SIGHS WEARILY)
(DOOR CLOSES)
CESAR: No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! No, no!
ARAM: We’re here to see Crassus.
Someone froze our accounts.
Someone’s messing with the…
No, no, no, no, no!
I’ll be in the car if you need me, okay?
What…
(DOOR CLOSES)
You know, when I heard you were shot, I was pissed…
that I didn’t get to do it myself.
(SCOFFS)
CLODIO: Ah… It’s a joke.
But you never had a sense of humor.
(TAP DANCING)
I have a sense of humor.
And I have everything else that you have.
Brains, family,
name, talent.
It’s injected the wrong way, but I share your passions.
…creation…
Creation…
…destruction.
You know, your way,
it’s meticulous and it’s hygienic,
but it’s fucking soulless.
And my way is real, and I want it.
I want it all. I want the moon.
And I’m going to have it.
WOW: Clodio.
Creation…
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
(SHUSHES)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Darling, what is it?
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
Our accounts are frozen.
I’m in a position where I can do
all kinds of things on my own, Cesar.
(LAUGHING)
(SITAR PLAYING)
(GASPS)
Oh, my God…
It can all be yours, Cesar,
everything.
These diamonds mean nothing to me.
Take me.
Take my love.
CRASSUS: Cesar!
Come in. Come in, Cesar.
You got to be careful, huh?
Yeah. Okay.
You just sit right here.
Here. Here.
Oh, let me just see…
I came to ask why…
our accounts are frozen.
Frozen?
Must be a mistake, son.
Wow, do you know anything about this?
“Moxie.”
CESAR: Uncle…
Yes.
Be remembered…
for your generosity.
CRASSUS: Remembered?
(WOW CLEARS THROAT)
I’m not going anywhere.
What’s a seven-letter word
for “God’s revenge on mankind”?
Pandora.
Bingo.
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)
Huey.
Pick up my hat.
HUEY: Pick up my hat.
ASSISTANT: Pick up my hat.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
AUTOMATED VOICE: Going up.
Yes, we are.
We are going up, and they are going down.
We just have to get our affairs in order,
tell all the little boys what to do.
One, two, three, yippee yay.
Hello.
Do you like my outfit?
(LAUGHS)
Yes, it’s beautiful, Wow.
Yes, Auntie Wow.
(CHUCKLES) Yes, it’s beautiful, Auntie Wow.
Does it make my ass look good?
I can’t see it.
Yes, it’s beautiful, Auntie Wow.
(CHUCKLES)
WOW: Kiss it.
Grandpa Crassus is beginning to doubt
that you’re giving up on politics.
You are a very bad, bad boy.
(KISSING)
But you’re lucky,
because Auntie Wow has come here to help you.
(CLODIO MOANING)
WOW: Are you lucky?
Yes.
Yes what?
Yes, Auntie Wow.
(MOANS)
(LIGHTS FLICKERING)
What’s that?
That’s your pussy.
I said, what is that?
That’s Cesar’s Megalopolis using up the city’s power.
Think it’s all over the city?
It’s all over the city.
Do you want to fuck me?
I want to fuck you so bad, Auntie Wow.
(WOW GRUNTS)
Then take your pants off and get on the table.
CLODIO: Yes, Auntie Wow.
WOW: Now,
your grandfather insisted on a prenuptial agreement
so that I can’t inherit his bank.
Therefore…
you and I are going to do a takeover.
You and your Auntie Wow,
and she knows how.
Mm.
Yes, Auntie Wow.
One, you will suggest to Crassus…
Yes.
…that you become interim
CEO of his bank,
that they draft up a memo of his support
and that you two work…
Oh, fuck!
…on a “term sheet” together.
We’re gonna work on a term sheet…
WOW: Yeah.
…Auntie Wow.
You understand?
Now, he’ll think…
Yes.
…that he’s going to remain Chairman and CEO…
But he won’t.
…and keep you as interim CEO.
Two, when he does that…
Two.
Yes.
…you’re going to refuse, okay?
I’ll say, “No, no!”
And then all the friendly talks are going to fall apart.
(MOANING)
Okay.
You like obeying me, don’t you?
CLODIO: Yes.
I’ve come to ask if you’d consider saying
you support my becoming interim CEO.
CRASSUS: You cut your hair. CLODIO: I did.
You’re making an effort, good!
Well, what I would need is,
I would need a memo from the board, Grandpa,
saying you support my becoming interim CEO.
CRASSUS: You’re a banker now.
I’m proud of you.
Yeah, I’ll give you a title,
teach you the game.
Wait,
this term sheet says
that you would be interim CEO and Chairman.
Well, yeah. I mean, I don’t know.
Interim CEO… Huh.
And I would retire.
It’s not friendly.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
This is hostile. This is treacherous!
I didn’t mean…
Villainous!
I didn’t mean it to be hostile!
CRASSUS: Whose name is this?
CLODIO: I thought it was inevitable.
CRASSUS: Who signed this?
Just stay still, please.
I did what you asked.
Yes, indeed. Grandpa, please.
No! No!
(CRASSUS GRUNTING)
Get away from me! No!
Please, you have to lie down!
CRASSUS: I can’t…
(GRUNTING)
AIDE: Mr. Crassus!
CRASSUS: God, it was you who gave me my fortune.
And It will be the will of Chronos
to seek our revenge.
FUNDI: “Let us fall in love again
“and scatter gold dust all over the world.
“Let us become a new spring
“and feel the breeze drift in heaven’s scent.
“Let us dress the earth in green
“and like the sap of a young tree,

We’ve waited long enough, no?
If you don’t fight like hell, we’re gonna lose the city.
Keep what’s ours.
Cesar has failed,
Cicero has failed.

CLODIO: The city is ours!
MAYOR CICERO: Attention, attention.
Murder and violence stalk our streets…
We are here,
we are powerful,
and we are taking our country back!
Pulcher for the culture!

New Rome, the greatest country

by those men who propose to take charge
of the affairs of the government.

Oh, I used to hold you like this.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, look at you.
Look, she likes you.
Yeah.
You’re holding the future in your hands.
Don’t you want a better world for her?
Cesar is a reckless dreamer who will destroy the world
sooner than he can build a better one.
(BABY FUSSING)
Can’t you and I be like we were before?
Could we?
Can’t we, Julia?
My little girl, my angel?

I’m not concerned with my place in history.
What I am concerned about is time,
consciousness, and courage.
But what is time,
except a curve of past and future around us?
What is consciousness,
except a burst of the soul from inside?
And what is courage,
but the beginning of a vital conversation?
We’re in need of a great debate about the future!
We want every person in the world
to take part in that debate.

Director: Josh Cooley

Writers: Eric Pearson, Andrew Barrer, Gabriel Ferrari

Synopsis: The untold origin story of Optimus Prime and Megatron, who were once bonded like brothers before becoming the sworn enemies we know today. Together, they shaped the fate of Cybertron forever.
* * *
[electrical crackling]
[electronic pulsing]
Okay, let’s see what we got here.
Seen it. Seen it.
Huh. What’s this about?
At the dawn… dawn… dawn…
dawn… dawn… dawn…
[electronic speech echoing] [beeps, whirs]
[echoing continues, stops]
[blows]
Ah. Here we go.
[deep voice] At the dawn of time, there was our gracious and powerful creator, Primus.
To protect our universe, he sacrificed his life force, transforming himself into our planet, Cybertron.
From within Cybertron’s core, Primus birthed the first Transformers known as the Primes, the most powerful Transformers, appointed to lead and protect future generations.
To assist them, Primus created an entity of great power, the Matrix of Leadership.
The Matrix, there it is. Okay. Good. Come on. Keep going.
[deep voice] With the Matrix in the Primes’ possession, Cybertron’s natural power source, Energon, flowed in abundance, sustaining life across the planet.
[electronic voice] Attention! Unauthorized movement detected in archival vault.
Sector J-3.
[sentry] KDQ-12 to KDK-1.
Breaching archives in ten seconds.
[deep voice] For generations, there was peace and prosperity, until the Matrix of Leadership was lost, causing Energon to no longer flow.




[groans] Why does every legend about the Matrix end right there?
[sighs] One of these has to say what happened.
[electronic voice] Halt, criminal! Prepare to be detained!
Oh, hey there. Halt, criminal! Prepare to…
[electrical sputtering]
[alarm blares] Uh-oh.
Freeze! Get down!
Well, hello, guys. I’m so glad you’re here.
Which way is the exit?
[chuckles] I must’ve taken a wrong turn.
It’s that defective mining bot, Oreon Pix!
Orion Pax. Who cares?
We told you to never come back here!
Why are we all yelling? I’m gonna smash you!
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, hold on. No need for violence.
How about this: I run away, you chase me. We play that game. Huh?
Come on. You’re bigger, faster. It’ll be fun.
He doesn’t have a cog. Let’s give him a head start.
Why not? It’s not like he can transform.
Oh, yeah?
Well, watch this.
[wondrous music begins]
[music abruptly stops]
Get him!
[grunts]




I… I… Uh…
Something that flies. Something that flies.
[electronic voice] Prepare to be detained!
Halt, criminal! Prepare to be detained!
Halt, criminal!
[electronic whirring]
[grunts, yells]
Come on! Start! Come on!
Whoa! [indistinct electronic speech]
[grunts]
Whoa. No, no, no, no! [yells]
There he is!
[grunts]
Ha-ha! So long, suck…
[overlapping chatter]
Ooh, Energon.
Evening, everyone. Pardon me.
[grunts] Hey!
[laughs]
Whoa!
Ah, it’s Orion. Seriously, again?
[chuckling] Okay, fellas! Thanks for the head start.
You want to give me another one?
You’re dead! I’ll take that as a no.
[grunts] Hey! Watch where you’re going!




Oh… What did you say, no-cog?
Sorry, sir, I didn’t mean you.
I was referring to the bot who was behind you.
What? Where’d he go?
The filthy red and blue bot?
Has a big mouth, squeaky joints, gives off a corroded metallic stench?
Where is he? He went that way.
When I get my hands on that bot…
All right, all clear.
Okay, D-16, I may be a little rusty, but “corroded”? That is too far.
Let me guess. Chased out of the archives?
[laughs] Yeah. I had to jump out of a window this time.
Almost died. [laughs] It was wild.
And digging through ancient data is worth dying for?
Yes, it is.
I need a new best friend.
If there are clues in our recorded history that can help locate the Matrix of Leadership, they’re in the archives.
Sentinel Prime, the Sentinel Prime, is up on the surface right now, risking his life for us in search of the Matrix.
That’s exactly what I’m doing. I’m trying to help him.
Yeah, okay. [laughs]
The sooner Energon flows again, the sooner we won’t have to mine for it.
Don’t you want to choose your own path, do whatever you want?
We’re miners. We mine, that’s all.
No, there has got to be something more I can do. I can feel it.
Oh, yeah? Like the time you had a “feeling” you could transform without a cog?




You said you were never gonna mention that again.
Took me three days to pry you open.
Your feelings get you in trouble.
Yeah, yeah.
Just trust in Sentinel Prime. I do trust in him.
Hey, if we did have cogs…
I’d transform into a shovel and beat you.
I don’t like how fast you answered that.
But listen, if you did beat me, I couldn’t give you this awesome Megatronus Prime thing I have here. It’s cool.
I’ll give it to someone else. What Megatronus Prime thing?
Ah, it’s nothing. Just a, you know, mint-condition Megatronus Prime decal, first edition.
[gasps] What?
If you don’t want it, I can just throw it away.
Throw it away? Don’t… That’s not funny. Let me see.
Wait. Don’t grab. You’re gonna crease it.
You know, Sentinel says Megatronus was the…
The strongest Prime to ever live.
I know, buddy.
Looks good on you. Ah, it’s really cool.
Thanks. Always got your back.
No matter what.
[electronic voice] Approaching sublevel station. Stand clear of doors.
Mining teams, prepare to unload.
[electrical whirring, crackling]
Metal to the pedal, drill bits. This is it.
How much Energon have you mined under my leadership?
[all] So much, Elita-1!
And how perfect is my mining record?
[all] So perfect, Elita-1!
We are a mere 30 units of Energon away from my promotion to supervisor.
Are you happy for me?
[all] So happy, Elita-1!
[Orion] Elita… I mean Captain,
you are looking especially shiny this morning. New polish?
Orion Pax, I’m sorry that I somehow
gave you the impression that we’re friends.
Apology accepted.
Light up that wall! Let’s go! Ten seconds!
Happy to take the lead today, Captain.
Feeling like I have enough power in me
to drill down and touch Primus myself.
You don’t have the touch or the power.
Ready positions, rust buckets! Let’s go!
She’s in a good mood today. Mm-hmm.
You ready? Always ready.
Let’s punch in.
[Elita] Here we go. This one won’t be open long.
Brace it up!
Here we go! Bridge!
[miner] Brace up!




Lower channel is open.
[crackling] [whirring]
[miner 2] Drill power on max! [tools whirring]
[miner 3] Low bridge!
Drill it out!
I tapped a vein!
[sputtering, metallic thud]
[metallic groaning]
It’s unstable! We got to go, we got to move!
[electronic pulse]
[all yelling]
[roar building]
Evacuate!
[all yelling]
Everyone out! Evacuate immediately!
The tunnel is closing.
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!
You with me, D? [D-16] On your six! Keep going!
Look out!
[electrical whirring, sputtering]
[pained groan]
Jazz is stuck!
Elita, we’ve got a trapped miner.
I’m falling back to assist.
[Elita] Negative. Do not break protocol. Evacuate!
We’re gonna need more lift.
It’s closing! Just grab your pack and go.
Yeah. Good idea.
What? No, I didn’t mean it!
[grunts] [electronic whirring]
Pull him clear!
[groans, yells]
[Elita] Pax, what’s happening?
Nothing much. Just normal protocol-following stuff.
It’s all good. [deep rumbling]
Oh, that’s not good. [rumbling swells]
Orion Pax, could you please exit the tunnel of death?
[Orion] Elita, it’s about to get messy out there!
[electronic pulse] [all grunting]
Go, go, go!
[mechanical whirring]
Run! Run!
Hurry! We’re not gonna make it!
Come on! Go, go, go!
[all yelling]
[electrical sputtering]
What the hell, Pax? I told you to evacuate.
I did, eventually. If I get fired because of you…
Oh, please. They’re not gonna fire you.
Elita-1, you’re fired.




What? Why? I followed protocol to the letter.
That is true. I was the one who broke the rules.
No one asked you!
Darkwing, please, I’ve worked too hard for this.
You are no-cog bots with limited options.
Report to waste management immediately.
Waste management?
Elita… Next time, why don’t you stop and think
before you ruin someone’s life?
I’m sorry!
[indistinct chatter]
Hey, Darkwing! Don’t do it.
I may not have a cog, but my finger can transform.
Guess which one? I’ll give you a “limited option.”
[imitates mechanical creak] [growls]
Excuse me, sir.
Allow me. [grunts]
I apologize on his behalf for the…
[slow groan] Why?
[D-16] That really hurt. [sighs]
What’d you expect? He’s metal.
You know you were out of line,
talking back to a superior like that.
Darkwing was out of line. He deserves it.
[sighs]
Aren’t you tired of being treated like we’re nothing?
He had every right to hit me. I interfered.
Hey, and I appreciate you having my back.
I’m glad you were there with me
to get punched in the face. That was fun.
[laughs] Anytime, buddy. [electronic tones]
[electronic voice] Attention, all sectors.
Stand by for a live transmission from Sentinel Prime.
He’s back? He’s back already? Maybe he found the Matrix.
[chatter] [electronic whirring]
Is it on? Okay, thank you.
Hello, my friends.
Hello, Iacon City!
Hello to our saviors, the industrious miners
who toil selflessly to maintain our Energon reserves.
I celebrate you. [crowd cheering]
Humility and presence! That’s leadership!
Ah! Nobody does it better!
Once again, I have narrowly returned with my fleet
after another treacherous expedition
across the desolate, dangerous surface of our planet.
I departed with hopes of finding the Matrix of Leadership,
the key to bringing balance to Cybertron.
I regret to inform you
that we’ve returned empty-handed.
[disappointed groans]
This is a setback, but not a failure.
Rest assured, I will find the Matrix of Leadership,
so that Energon can flow again.
But that’s in the future.
Right now, I think we all deserve a little fun!
Tomorrow, there will be no work. All shifts off
because tomorrow is the Iacon 5000!
[raucous cheers] Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
My favorite event.
A high-octane race all across Iacon City.
Let’s all see which competitor can prove they are truly more than meets the eye.
[cheering continues] [laughs excitedly]
[Orion whispering] D.
Psst! Hey, D.
[groans groggily]
Oh, good, you’re up. Come on, I have an idea.
[D-16] Whatever this is, it better be good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Listen.
All right, what if… what if…
what if tomorrow
we ran in the Iacon 5000, huh?
What if kill you for waking me up?
No, no, no, hear me out.
We don’t even have to win!
Oh, that’s good, because we wouldn’t.
But… But if we beat just one Transformer,
it proves we’re just as good as they are.
Not only would we go down in history,
the mining bots that did the impossible,
but we would show everyone that we’re…
we’re capable of so much more!
Or we get publicly humiliated
and then busted back to tier one.
Yeah, but at least we would’ve done something, you know?
Pax… Come on, D.
Pax.
We’re mining bots who can’t transform.
We can’t fly, we can’t roll,
we can’t race.
Come on, let’s go.
[sighs]
All right, fine.
Yeah, maybe you’re right.
Maybe.
[D-16] The Iacon 5000 is finally here!
[Orion] I have a surprise for you. Come on.
Where are you going? The stadium’s that way.
Yeah, yeah, I know. Follow me.
Great. We’re gonna be late now.
I wanted good seats.
We came all this way to miss the opening ceremony. This is wonderful!
Trust me, I know what I’m doing.
Hold up!
[electronic pulse] [groans, sighs]
Get caught in one of those, it’ll launch you halfway across the city.
Okay, where are you taking me?
[mechanical whirring]
Don’t be a glitch, this will be totally worth it. Trust me.
Hey, you don’t be a glitch.
Look, I know this is, like, fun for you,
like, we’re joking around,
but if you make me miss any part of the Iacon 5000,
I swear I will smelt your face right off your…
[announcer] Welcome to the Iacon 5000. There they are.
Put your hands together as today’s competitors are taking the field.
[D-16] Look! There’s Thunderglide and Behemoth!
This is unbelievable! I feel like I’m in the race!
You did this for me?
No.
I did this for us.
[announcer] And now the moment you’ve all been waiting for.
The icon of Iacon!
The savior of Cybertron!
Quintessons fear him, but we love him!
Our leader, the one and only…
Sentinel Prime!
[cheers, applause] I love you, Sentinel!
Yes! It feels so good to be here with you all today.
[raucous cheers]
My friends. My Cybertronian family.
[crowd quiets]
It has been precisely 50 cycles
since the Quintessons attacked our home.
Fifty cycles since we lost the Matrix of Leadership
and our Energon supply dried up.
Fifty cycles since the battle that killed the other Primes,
my brothers and sisters in arms.
Today we honor the Primes who gave their lives for ours
and we show them that the strength of Cybertron will never be diminished.
Racers, on your marks!
[cheers, applause] [mechanical whirring]
I can’t believe we get to watch from the starting line.
The best seats in the house! [beeps, whirs]
Why’d you bring jetpacks?
[announcer] Get set!
It’s time to show them we are more than meets the eye.
Oh, no.
[electronic pulse]
[announcer] And they’re off!
[yelps, grunts]
[grunts, yells]
Are you crazy? Sure feels like it.
[announcer] The Iacon 5000 has begun!
I’m sorry, are those miners in the race?
Miners! Those are miners, like us!
[announcer] I can’t believe what I’m seeing here! Miners trying to run
in the Iacon 5000! You’ve got to be kidding me.
[announcer] This is insane!
There are miners in the race! Miners?
No way! They can’t even transform!
It’s Orion Pax and D-16!
[announcer] This is a first in Iacon 5000 history.
How are they going to survive?
[electronic pulsing, zipping]
If we survive this, I’m gonna kill you!
I accept those terms.
[announcer] It’s Tailwind pulling into the lead down the main stretch
followed by Strafe and Skyfire!
[electronic pulse] [yelps]
[D-16] Hey, look out! [grunts]
I owe you one. More like a thousand.
I can’t believe we’re not in last place!
[D-16 screams]
[mechanical whirring] [Darkwing] Eat it, miner!
[announcer] Darkwing delivers a devastating blow! [Orion] Gotcha!
We’re not fast enough! Improvise!
[Spinout] Hey! Get off! [D-16] Spinout! Big fan!
[Jetstorm] Hey! [D-16] Jetstorm, I’m so sorry. Big fan! [yells]
Get off!
[grunts]
[laughs]
Time it just right!
And… now! [grunts]
Move!
[pained yell]
[announcer] And the miners have fallen way behind.
We can now focus on the real contenders in this race.
[panting] [mechanical swell]
[electronic pulse] [both yelling]
[Darkwing grunts]
[announcer] I don’t believe it! The miners take down Darkwing!
Oh, miners!
Great effort, Darkwing!
That worked! It actually worked!
Is this the dumbest thing we’ve ever done?
Oh, yeah, it’s up there!
[mechanical whirring] [screams]
[grunts]
No, no, no!
Whoa!
[grunts, yelps]
Wait!
Go, go, go!
[announcer] A four-bot pileup in the magnetic tunnel
and the two miners are now in first position!
[cheers, applause] This is unbelievable!
Ah! [crowd gasps]
D!
No. Go. Leave me!
No, we do this together.
[announcer] One miner is now carrying the other
mere steps from the finish line
in the most amazing, sensational, dramatic, heartrending, exciting,
thrilling finish in the history of…
[both grunt]
We have a winner!
Chromia comes from behind to take the prize.
Talk about an Iacon 5000 for the ages.
[both panting]
Well, second place is still pretty good.
[electronic whooshing]
[intercom voice] Paging Dr. Ratchet. Dr. Ratchet to Medical Bay 94.
Do not worry. You will be fixed up in no time.
[pained groan] Did I win?
You participated.
[wounded bot] Yay!
So…
how long do you think we’ll be here?
I’m not talking to you.
You know what? I can’t believe you made me do that.
We are so screwed! Thought you weren’t talking to me.
Hey, look, I know it’s all a big joke to you. But not me.
I was paying my dues. I was going places.
And now they’re gonna bust me down
I… I don’t even know how many tiers!
I’m sorry, D.
But come on, didn’t you feel it?
Even for just a second, didn’t you feel liberated?
Didn’t you feel like you were something else?
Like you could be more than what they say you are?
Yeah, I felt it. I did.
But it doesn’t matter.
We’re going to get punished and demoted.
[sighs] Sentinel Prime saw the whole thing.
This is so embarrassing. [metallic clanking]
[electronic beeping, whirring]
It’s clear.
Orion Pax.
D-16.
What you two did today
was one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen.
Sir, this is all my idea, and we’re so sorry.
I loved it!
You did?
How could anyone not love it?
You gave my best racers a real run for their money.
So we’re not getting demoted?
Demoted?
[laughing]
[both laughing nervously]
Demoted.
[laughter continues]
What is happening?
[laughs awkwardly]
The fact of the matter is we’re halfway into the first shift
since the race ended and that mining crew has already reached 150% quota.
You inspired them to work harder!
Sentinel Prime, sir,
we joined the race to show everyone our potential.
That we bots can do more than just mine…
Outstanding! I love a bot that can think for himself.
Perhaps you two could tour the mines,
speak to your brethren, and help them see their potential.
[laughs] Wow! Okay, great.
[stammering] That sounds incredible.
I would love to… Sir, it’s time.
Ah, yes.
I’m sorry, friends.
We’re preparing our next travel to the surface.
But in the meantime, I’ve got a treat for you.
Hang tight. Airachnid, have someone escort these heroes
to my personal service facilities.
Best care in Iacon.
Until next time, legends.
Sentinel Prime. [laughs] The Sentinel Prime!
You still mad at me? I am less mad at you.
I’m telling you, D… I got a feeling that everything’s gonna change
and we’re gonna go… [heavy footsteps]
[growling] Miners!
Hi, Darkwing.
[Orion] Oh, no, no, no. [D-16] No! [yells]
Wait, wait! You don’t understand!
We were supposed to go to Sentinel Prime’s service pod!
You two dolts aren’t going to see anyone ever again.
I’ll make sure of that.
You’re making a mistake! Ask Sentinel!
[groans] I hate that guy!
[clattering]
[clattering continues]
You! How did you get down here?
There’s no access to this level.
There is nobody down here but me.
[stammers indistinctly] Oh, my gosh, you’re real!
You’re others! You’re not… me!
You’re here, and you’re not me!
[laughs]
Uh, yeah. Awesome!
I am so sorry. That must have been weird for you.
I just haven’t had a lot of company
since they put me down here in sublevel 50.
Fifty? But there are only 40 sublevels.
That’s what I thought!
Turns out there are ten more, and they are not pleasant.
Probably why nobody ever really talks about them.
How long have you been down here?
How long have I been here? [laughs]
Let’s see, somewhere between a long time and forever?
I mean, I had other jobs, but I kept getting reassigned
’cause I’m so good at what I do.
Oh! I’m B-127, by the way.
But you can call me B.
And I’m actually working on some nicknames.
The one I’m floating right now is Badassatron.
Which is actually pronounced… [deep voice] “Badassatron.”
But if you have any critiques…
Yeah, great. How do we get out of here?
Great question. You don’t.
We don’t? Nope.
We have limited access to the waste management area,
but the new shift manager there does not like distractions.
No, they prefer we stay here on the task at hand.
Which is? Oh!
The scrap comes in from the chute there
onto the conveyor belt.
Our job is to look for anything that might be worth salvaging
before it hits the furnace and gets smelted.
So you watch garbage burn.
Yes!
It is so great that you’re here now.
I can’t wait to learn everything about you.
And then tell you everything about me!
I have a lot of hopes and dreams that I am just dying to share
with one or two new best friends.
Uh, yeah, I would love to…
[splutters] Where are my manners?
Come on, I’ll introduce you to the rest of the crew.
Hey, guys, we’ve got company!
This is EP-508,
this is A-A-Tron, and this fella here is Steve.
“Steve”? Yeah, he’s foreign.
Question: Do they talk back to you?
Um, they’re not real.
[laughing] Jeez, you think I’m that crazy?
It’s just you’ve been down here a…
No, I was talking to Steve. [beeps and whirs]
[indistinct robotic speech] [laughs]
Classic Steve.
What is that? Look at this guy.
[mocks electronic speech] It’s coming from inside.
Oh! Steve! No!
I am so sorry. [dramatically] Steve, no!
We can fix it, don’t worry. My Steve!
[voice over transmission] Quintesson ambush!
Calling the High Guard for immediate support. Immediate support!
That’s Alpha Trion.
One of the Primes?
Repeat, Zeta Prime has fallen!
It’s an SOS message. Protect the Matrix!
Sending location coordinates. Sending location coordinates.
Holy Primus!
Those are coordinates to a location on the surface.
This could be where the Primes died in the Quintesson war.
Which means this is where we could find
the Matrix of Leadership.
What are you talking about? It’s an old beacon inside a statue made of garbage.
Or it’s a clue of how we could find
the Matrix of Leadership. No. No way. Absolutely not!
Hey, D, come on, this could be our chance to show everyone we’re not…
You already tried to “show everyone”
in the race you tricked me into running,
which got us stuck down here
in this waste hole with this, uh…
really cool guy.
Oh, thank you. I’m just saying…
There’s a reason no one goes to the surface.
It’s dangerous!
I’m waiting right here until Sentinel Prime finds us.
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.
Well, we’ll just stay here forever. That cool with you, B?
Forever? This is great!
I have new coworkers and roommates.
There’s plenty of room now that Steve is dead.
I usually sleep on the conveyor belt, but you can totally have it.
I’ll sleep in the corner next to A-A-Tron.
Plenty of room for you to stretch out, too,
’cause you’re taller than I am. Know what I mean?
Hey, D, what do you think Sentinel’s reaction would be if you personally handed him
the Matrix of Leadership that you found?
Okay, stop. I know what you’re trying to do.
And it’s definitely working. I’m in.
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy. How do we get to the surface?
Pfft! You kidding me? The surface?
Easy. I know a way.
But it won’t be easy.
[D-16] Why is there so much trash? Ah!
[Orion] Warn me next time, please. My mouth was open.
[B-127] Only 49 sublevels to go!
Waste-disposal trains are the only vehicles
that go all the way to the surface.
[D-16] Yeah, but they don’t allow passengers. The trains are autonomous.
Yeah, that’s the “won’t be easy” part.
It’s perfect. We’ll be safe inside the train.
[worker] That’s the last one. Send ‘er up!
[door whirs, thuds]
[Elita] Hold up! One more.
I’ll lock it down.
[electronic beeps, clicks]
[laughs] Thanks for being an idiot, whoever you are.
Turning you in will definitely get me promoted back up a rank or two.
Got her! [grunting]
No, wait, I…
Elita! Stop!
Orion? Hold on, let me…
Security! Sound the ala…
[grunts angrily]
She’s headed to the engine! Don’t worry, I got this.
Hold on, let me explain! We’re on a mission!
So am I. To ruin your life.
[yells] [all grunt]
Elita, wait. We found a message. We know where…
This bot is crazy! Who is she?
Dead end, Elita. There’s no way…
Well, she’s gone.
[all grunting]
[groans]
Whoa!
Why? Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this?
Climb faster!
[all groaning]
Gotcha! [grunts]
Ah, the surface.
It’s beautiful.
[B-127] I am speechless.
Elita, listen to me.
We know where the Matrix of Leadership is.
Oh, sure. And I’m really a Prime.
I just prefer loading crates of toxic waste.
Whoa. Where did you get this?
From my friend Steve. Orion killed him.
I did not kill Steve. He was never alive.
What? Look.
Sentinel told us he was going to the surface,
and then we found this message.
We figured that we could hand deliver it to him
or scout the locations ourselves.
Whichever comes first.
This was too important to wait.
It will change all of our lives.
[inhales sharply] No, no, no, no.
I’m not going to get demoted again because of you.
I’m turning this rig around and I’m notifying the…
[rumbling] Hey, guys? Guys?
What is that?
[rumbling swells]
Is it getting bigger?
Or closer?
[alarm blares]
[rumbling intensifies]
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Are you closing? Don’t close. Stop closing.
It’s closed!
[Elita] Oh, come on!
[rumbling, alarm continue]
Oh, now I know why no one comes to the surface!
[mechanical whirring]
[grunts]
[all exclaiming]
[all yelling]
[yelling reverberates]
[Orion] Elita?
[wind blowing]
Elita? [Elita groans]
You okay?
[grunts]
Please stop punching me in the face.
[B-127, distant] Can you help?
Iacon… The train…
Where’s the train? Relax, okay? Here it comes.
And there it goes.
Okay, I was wrong about that. It was going the other way.
[Elita screams]
[scream echoing]
[grunting] Okay, so I think this is us,
and if we follow the path to… Now you listen to me,
Mr. “Zero Seconds Since My Last Accident”!
I’ll go on your little quest because I don’t have a choice.
But I carry the map, I navigate, and if this leads to nothing,
then I’m dragging you and those two idiot go-bots
back to Iacon City
and to the first supervisor depot we see,
at which point you will explain everything that’s happened,
using words that reflect me
in a very positive light! Got it?
Yeah, okay. Deal. Great. All right.
Let’s go! She’s joining us?
[laughs eagerly] Fantastic!
Hi there. Uh, Elita, right? Am I saying that right?
Wanted to formally introduce myself.
I’m B-127. You kneed me in the face earlier, back there.
You can call me B, or Badassatron.
It’s a nickname some of the guys gave me.
I don’t know. I didn’t give it to myself or anything.
Actually, it’s pronounced… [deep voice] “Badassatron,”
in case you were wondering.
[deep voice] Badassatron.
You like that, right?
[deep voice] Badass… I’m gonna need you to talk less.
Sure! No… Yeah, no problem.
What am I talking less about, my nickname?
That’s fine with me. Got some mountains over here…
Hey. You’re thinking about what you’ll say
when you hand the Matrix to Sentinel, aren’t you?
I can’t help it.
D, we’re really doing this.
So glad I’m out here with you. This was a great idea.
[B-127] I’m just having a good time.
How much further is the Matrix on the map?
Make an educated guesstimate.
This is the coolest thing that has ever happened
to anyone anywhere, I’m telling you!
[B-127] ♪ Not one, not two Not three, but four ♪
♪ Four best friends who are Walking through the door ♪
There’s no doors, we’re outside.
Hey, look, there’s more of it over here.
What is it? It’s not metal.
It’s like some kind of weird nature. It’s weird.
So are they.
[B-127] ♪ Going to the Matrix ♪
♪ With my best friends ♪
[deep rumble] What was that?
[electronic blips]
[wind blowing] [light metallic clinking]
Um…
I think this is not right. We should go.
Yeah, good idea. Run!
[all panting] What are we running from?
[rumbling]
[all panting]
[rumbling, clattering]
[mechanical warbling]
[D-16] What is that? [Orion] Oh, no.
It’s a Quintesson ship. [Elita] What?
What do we do? What do we do? Shh! Quiet.
[rapid metallic footsteps]
[all gasping]
[electronic whirring, pulsing]
It’s scanning for life-forms. Move, move!
[whirring]
Wait! [gasping]
[panting]
Go, go, go, go!
[grunts]
Come on!
They’re not gonna make it.
[straining] Whoa.
[straining]
[grunts, exhales]
What… What were they searching for?
Someone to hug, B. How should I know?
I’m not waiting around to find out.
This way. We’re close.
[Orion] Quintessons haven’t been here for 50 cycles.
[Elita] It doesn’t make sense. There’s nothing out here.
A cave with teeth. Nothing scary about that.
[B-127] Knives coming out of the ceiling. Amazing.
Everyone, do we have to go insi…?
[electronic blips] Okay, yep, we’re going in.
Why shouldn’t we? Just walking into the scariest place
I’ve ever seen in my entire life.
This is ridiculous.
I don’t believe it.
[Orion] The Primes.
[Elita] We’re here.
Megatronus Prime.
Zeta Prime.
The Matrix!
It’s gone.
Let’s keep looking.
Hey, guys!
It’s Alpha Trion!
[Orion] He’s powered down.
But his spark is still lit.
[electrical crackling]
Quintesson ambush!
Attack!
[groans]
Message before…
Whoa, whoa, it’s okay! It’s okay.
You’re safe now.
The war is over.
[sighs, grunts softly]
[weak mechanical whirs]
[grunts weakly]
I failed you, old friend.
You deserved so much better than this end.
No, you didn’t fail.
We heard your message. We’ve come to find the Matrix.
Your transformation cogs. What happened to you?
Who are you?
We’re cogless miners, from Iacon.
Miners? Why?
Well, we’ve had to drill for Energon
ever since it stopped flowing.
Impossible.
That’s why we came. To fix things.
If we find the Matrix of Leadership
and get it to Sentinel Prime, he can fix…
Sentinel is no Prime.
What? He’s broken. Fantastic.
What are you talking about? Why would you say that?
Sentinel Prime is our protector.
He’s been saving us from the Quintessons ever since…
You have not been saved. You’ve been living a lie.
I saw the truth with my own eyes.
Come. I will show you.
[heavy footsteps]
For thousands of cycles, the war with the Quintessons
had been a brutal conflict.
Until Sentinel, the principal aide to the Primes,
intercepted an enemy transmission.
There was going to be a secret gathering of Quintesson commanders.
Their elimination could end the war.
It was a mission so important, we Primes took it on ourselves.
We agreed to meet Sentinel for his sensitive intel in secret,
here in this cave.
But we were not alone.
[chittering]
[Prime] Quintessons! [Prime 2] They’re here!
[Prime 3] It’s a trap! Battle positions!
Hold the line! [Prime] Primus be with us!
[laserfire pulsing]
For Cybertron!
[Alpha Trion] We were outnumbered, but stood as one.
Our victory was near.
Until we were betrayed.
[metallic slice]
[grunts]
[pained yell]

[grunting]
Sentinel, why?
For all the power of Cybertron.
[Alpha Trion] But Sentinel never understood the true power of what he desired.
The Matrix of Leadership can only be wielded
by one that Primus himself deems worthy.
And Sentinel most certainly was not.
No!
Wait. Hold on. You’re saying that the Matrix of Leadership just vanished?
No.
No, no, no. That is impossible. I don’t believe it.
Why would Sentinel do that?
To make a bargain.
A bargain? With who?
[deep rumbling]
With the new rulers of Cybertron.
[Orion] The Quintessons.
[Elita] There are so many.
[electronic whirring]
He’s here.
Sentinel Prime is here.
[warbling]
[chittering]
Keep your eyes open. They always are.
[gasping]
[guttural chittering]
[Elita] I load those crates.
Those are filled with contaminated metal.
I don’t understand.
What do the Quintessons want with toxic waste?
Our Energon.
Traitor! D, no.
[grunts, groans]
[straining] I know what I promised you
but our mines, they’re running out!
There’s barely enough Energon for us.
[roars]
I swear I will get you the rest.
Triple-time every mining shift.
No miner gets a break until I get my Energon.
All of it! Let’s go.
[ship rumbling]
Now you have seen the truth.
Every day…
Every single day of my life
has been a lie.
My God, I knew it!
Deep down, I always felt something was off.
He deceived everyone.
Sentinel bought himself power and then put us to work paying off his debt.
I can’t believe it.
Well, obviously, I can believe it,
I just saw it, but I still…
I can’t believe it.
Sentinel lied
to my face. [Orion] It was all a sham.
How could we have been so gullible?
Oh, this… this is going to change everything.
[thudding]
[grunting]
You just had to do it, didn’t you?
Me? What did I do?
You just had to go to the surface,
had to enter the Iacon 5000.
You just had to break protocol!
Who cares about protocol? I do!
I care!
Because nothing bad happens when you stay on protocol!
Sentinel Prime has been forcing us
to work in the mines until our gears strip,
and all the while he’s been giving the Energon away to our greatest enemies!
And what do you think he’s going to do to us when he finds out that we know?
I’m not thinking about what he’s going to do,
I’m thinking about what we’re going to do.
That’s the whole thing!
You’re never thinking about anything else, just yourself!
Fantastic! Another Orion Pax master plan. I can’t wait to hear this.
Don’t you want to stop him?
No, I want to kill him!
I want to put Sentinel in chains
and march him through the mines
so everyone can see him for the false Prime that he is!
I want him to suffer and then to die in darkness.
But we all know that it doesn’t matter
what I want, right, Pax?
The fact is, we’re just cogless bots. Right?
[D-16 chuckles bitterly] We had limited options, and now… now we have none.
No son or daughter of Cybertron is born without a cog.
Oh, yeah. I’ve been with myself since I came online,
and this slot’s always been empty.
What are you saying? Are you saying…
No. No way. Nobody could be that evil, not even Sentinel.
He removed your cogs before you came online.
We were born with transformation cogs, but he…
He took them from us.
What defines a Transformer… [grunts]
is not the cog in his chest
but the spark that resides in their core.
A spark that gives you the will to make your world better.
My fellow Primes had that spark.
And I see their strength in you.
Take their cogs and access your full potential.
Prima.
Onyx.
Alchemist.
Micronus.
Warriors of noble spirit, loyalty, strength.
Their uniqueness enhanced by these.
[electronic whirring]
[electronic whirring continues]
They were one. You are one.
All are one!
Wait. We have… You… You gave us…
The ability to change your world.
How you choose to use that power is up to you.
[laughs]
[heavy thud]
They’ve found us.
Oh, yes! Time to fight back!
No. You must return to Iacon City and alert everyone.
Embedded in this are the records I have shown you.
Use it to reveal the truth.
We will.
This tunnel leads to the mountains.
Cybertron’s future is in your hands.
[thudding boom] We’re out of time.
We got to move!
Wait, we can’t just leave you here.
Your fight will come, my friend.
Primus has a purpose for us all.
But this fight… [heavy booming thud]
This fight is mine.
Now go! [thudding continues]
Stand down, old timer.
Ah. Old, you say?
[rumbling]
[laserfire pulsing]
[roars]
[electrical crackling]
[laserfire pulsing]
[roars]
Not too old for you.
[roaring]
We need to hurry!
I still think we have better odds
fighting than outrunning them.
Wait! We have cogs. We can transform now.
That’s right. Everyone ready? I was born ready.
On three. One…
[all yelling]
[faint yelling, grunting]
Ah!
[laserfire pulsing]
[grunting]
How do we use these things?
I don’t know. Just try.
[straining]
It’s working. Ha! It’s working!
My head! My head!
Whoa!
Help! Help!
This is not faster!
[yells, grunts]
Oh, come on!
And transform!
[yelling]
Wheels! I need wheels!
[laserfire pulsing]
[Elita yelling]
Whoa.

[mechanical whirring]
[B-127 yelling]
[mechanical whirring] Ha! [grunts]
[grunts, laughs]
Oh, wow.
We’re alive! I’ve never moved that fast.
That was incredible! Did you see me slide all over?
[overlapping chatter]
[laser blast]
[engine humming]
[mechanical whirring]
Yes!
[laughing deliriously]
Hey, whoa, buddy. You okay?
I’m great. Are you kidding me? We can transform!
We transform!
Oh, hey! I know.
We’re wasting time. We have to get back to Iacon.
Looks like the fastest way
back to Iacon is… Here, I got it.
Hey, what are you doing?
Don’t worry, I got it. Yeah, but be careful.
Our proof is inside and you’re spilling it everywhere.
I… got… it.
Okay.
Follow me.
[wheezes]
Alpha Trion!
You are still alive. Would you look at that?
You look horrible.
Traitor. You are a disgrace.
Primus will surely… Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.
I seized an opportunity to take control of my future.
Anything to get out of working for you
and that boring council of elders.
Seriously, I would watch you Primes
spend half the day losing a war
and the other half sitting around waxing poetic about loyalty and honor.
And now look at you.
Hear my words: You will fall.
And a new Prime will rise…
There you go again.
I don’t want to listen to any more speeches.
[groans]
There were others in the cave with you.
Who are they?
They are to be your undoing.
You’ve lost, Sentinel. Nothing you can do…
[pained grunt] [electrical crackling]
[body thuds]
Oh, didn’t I just say no speeches?
You heard me, right?
This is what I’m talking about. Unbelievable.
All of them are like that. So disrespectful.
[sighs]
Okay. Hunt down the others.
With pleasure.
[engines humming]
Hey, buddy.
Oh. Hey.
You’ve been a little quiet. Are you all right?
All I can think about is Sentinel’s smirking face.
He must pay for what he’s done. Someone has to do something.
We are. With Alpha’s proof inside that device, we will show everyone the truth.
You honestly believe it’ll be that easy?
Iacon doesn’t want to hear the truth.
They worship Sentinel.
There’s got to be a better way to bring him down.
We have to trust everyone will believe what we show them.
I trusted Sentinel!
With everything.
I will never trust a so-called leader ever again.
There’s only one bot I know I can trust…
[electrical crackling]
[grunting]
[electronic sputtering]
[voice] All right, wake them up.
[gasps]
[breathes heavily]
[grunts]
Now, are you spies
or just incompetent lackeys?
We’re not spies. But he is incompetent.
Scanning electrical impulses. He speaks the truth.
That just means he believes himself, like any spy would.
[muffled indistinct speech]
Uh, why is he gagged?
He wouldn’t stop talking.
[muffled speech continues] Even when he was unconscious?
Especially when he was unconscious!
Enough!
Two options for you!
One, we slowly dismantle each of you one bolt and screw at a time,
and really make sure you feel it.
Or two:
In exchange for a quick death,
you give us intel on the Energon trains,
access to the mines
or anything else that could hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.
Who exactly are you guys?
[muffled grunting, straining]
Ah!
The Cybertronian High Guard!
[growls] I told you it wasn’t tight enough!
Prestigious defenders of Iacon. Prestigious?
He’s right. I read all about you in the archives.
You were the most legendary warriors in all of Cybertron.
Look, look, look! That’s Starscream,
and you’re Shockwave, and Soundwave.
Raise your hand if “wave” is in your name. There’s a lot of “waves.”
Silence!
The yellow annoying one is correct.
Whoo!
We were once the High Guard.
We witnessed Sentinel’s betrayal, saw the Primes fall.
Since that day, we’ve been fighting from the shadows,
doing whatever we can to sabotage Sentinel.
That’s great! We’re… Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay. We’re good. Everyone relax.
I’m just saying we’re allies.
We were on our way back to Iacon,
and now with your help, we can unify Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.
The idea of a unified Cybertron is a myth.
All that counts is the strength of one bot over another!
[all cheering]
Okay. So, these guys are a little intense.
Yeah. Just a little.
Hey!
What are you doing?
I tell you what I’m not doing.
I’m not cowering in some busted ship, playing king of the throne.
I’m not pretending like I’m making a difference
by throwing one punch and then running away to hide!
I found out that Sentinel is rotten today,
and I’m gonna make him pay for it.
Today!
You think you can insult me and just walk away?
No one leaves here unless I say so.
[chuckles] Is that right?
Well, how can you say so
with my head in your teeth?
[grunts] D!
[grunts] [excited chatter]
[both grunting]
Whoa!
[grunting] [mechanical whir]
[growls] [grunts]
Hit me!
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more! [crowd cheers]
[laughs] [all] D-16! D-16! D-16!
You want to see the strength of one bot over another? Huh?
[voice crackling] Is that all you’ve got, tough bot?
Let’s go! Do it! Come on!
[yells angrily]
[mechanical whirring]
[panting]
Please! I beg you!
Stop! D, he’s not the enemy!
Bear witness!
This is the last time I show mercy!
Decide right now:
You can stay here in hiding, bowing before your pathetic leader,
or follow me as we march on Iacon
and I take down Sentinel once and for all!
[cheers, chanting]
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!
[chanting fades]
[distant rumbling]
[all screaming]
[laserfire pulsing]
B, come on!
[B-127 yelling]
[mechanical whirring]
[grunts]
[Airachnid] Engage all hostiles! I’ve got the bridge!
[grunts angrily]
[D-16 yelling]
[mechanical whirring]
[grunts]
Elita, get down!
[grunts]
[Orion coughs, clears throat]
I feel like someone dropped a cliff on me.
[groans] Where are the others?
Sentinel’s troops took as many prisoners as they could carry.
They got D-16 and B.
Oh, no.
And half of those High-Guard nutjobs.
[sighs]
Our proof.
It’s gone.
So, what do we do now?
D was right.
About what? Everything.
Look at it. Look around. This is a disaster.
It’s all my fault.
I should have stayed on protocol.
[sighs]
Listen to me. I really want you to hear this.
Are you listening?
I’m better than you.
Yeah, okay, I’m hearing you.
I’m better than you in every way,
except you have hope.
You always have. You went back into the mine to rescue Jazz.
You snuck up to the surface to find the Matrix of Leadership.
[chuckles] Yeah, and how’d that work out?
My point is,
that your instincts tell you to break protocol for a reason.
This blind optimism that you have
is why you make such bold and courageous choices,
that are also extremely stupid.
First time giving a pep talk?
You’re inspiring.
You can envision a better future that no one else can see.
And if we ever want to see B and D-16 again,
that is the Orion Pax that we need right now.
Listen to me.
We can do this.
Those Energon trains will be heading back to Iacon.
If we intercepted one…
Hell yes, I can reroute it. What else do we need?
Well, my bold instincts tell me we have to recruit some nutjobs.
I was afraid you’d say that.
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave. You in the back.
In order to save our captured friends, we have to act now.
How about I blast you back to Iacon?
[pained grunt] Oh! She punched me in my eye!
Everyone, shut up! All of you. Listen to him.
Most likely, our friends are being held captive
at the top of Sentinel’s tower.
A surprise attack would give us a chance to rescue them.
Impossible. We do not have enough soldiers or a way inside.
Elita will get us in. And I will get more troops.
Why should we follow you?
We will follow you.
Attention, High Guard. Prepare for battle.
What is our first move?
[quietly] We roll out.
What?
Louder.
[boldly] Transform and roll out!
I don’t understand. Why are we still alive?
Look at this rowdy bunch! The High Guard!
You know, you guys have been tough to find.
Every trip to the surface, I’ve been searching for you.
Tracking the bots in the cave led me right to them.
Oh-ho-ho!
You captured Starscream! It was too easy.
[high-pitch] I’m going to rip you apart piece by piece
so that your death is painful! [laughs]
You’ll regret the day you were…
You sound ridiculous. It’s weird.
Oh, D-16, what a tragic story you’ll be.
Atop the leaderboard in your sector and secretly a traitor.
I’m not a traitor. You’re the traitor.
Nuh-uh. You, all of you, are traitors.
You’ve been working with the Quintessons to sabotage my expeditions.
You’re the reason why I haven’t found the Matrix of Leadership yet.
None of that is true!
Oh, trust me, it’ll be very true
when I’m executing you in front of all of Iacon.
Because down here, the truth is what I make it.
[thud reverberates]
Well, well. What’s this about?
I’m not kneeling in front of you.
Feeling confident, are we?
You don’t scare me. You want to know why?
Please.
Because I don’t have anything left to lose.
You took it all.
I sure did.
[grunts]
[gasps] [groans]
Ah, Megatronus Prime.
Of course you were a fan. Megatronus was the coolest Prime!
The biggest! The baddest! The toughest!
That’s why, after I killed him,
I took his cog for myself.
He was greater than you’ll ever be!
I don’t know. I’m pretty great.
But I can understand why you’d want to wear his face over mine.
Here.
Let’s make sure it doesn’t come off.
[electrical crackling]
[pained shouts, groans]
Okay. [sighs]
[stammers] I can do this.
[miner] You can’t be serious. We just worked 22 shifts without a break!
These miners need rest and time to repair and…
Sentinel Prime wants more Energon.
So get back in the mines before I make you get back in the…
[aggressive thud]
[triumphant electronic jingle]
Who was that? Did you see who that was?
[miner] That can’t be him.
[Jazz] Is that…
It can’t be.
Orion? Jazz.
Is it really you?
Yeah, I know I, uh, look a little different.
“Little”?
There’s nothing “little” about you.
Uh, how is this possible?
Sentinel told us you died from your race injuries.
Sentinel is a liar.
What? Huh?
Look, I know how this will sound coming from me.
I was never the most focused miner.
But as you can see, everything is different now.
[mechanical whirring]
I went to the surface and I learned the truth.
My friends,
we were all born with transformation cogs.
And then Sentinel, he stole them from us.
He took away our ability to make our own decisions.
He stole our freedom.
But now, I’m offering you your first real choice.
You can work a 23rd shift and mine yourself to death
or fight back against Sentinel with me.
Right now.
How are we supposed to do that? We can’t fight. We don’t have cogs.
What defines a Transformer is not the cog in its chest
but the spark that resides in their core.
A spark that gives you the will to make your world better.
And that spark, Sentinel can never take from us.
There’s not enough of us. We’d need an army.
And we have one. Elita is bringing troops.
We are not alone in this.
If we want to be in control of our own destiny,
we will have to fight for it.
Now is the time for us to stand up…
[supportive chatter] for ourselves.
[scattered cheers]
Stand up for this injustice.
[cheers growing]
I promise you this fight will be worth it.
Follow me.
Nothing can stop us when we stand together.
[cheering, chanting] Together as one.
[all chanting] Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!
[Orion] Elita, it’s time.
You got it.
Buckle up, Blinky. We’re going in.
[groaning, gasping]
[determined groans]
Not a good idea.
[whispering] D, stay down. [groans]
Well, that’s a shame. [mechanical whirs]
You really were a great miner.
We’ve got a breach! Protect Sentinel!
[grunts]
They spotted us. It’s about to get bumpy.
High Guard, eject.
Come on! Move out!
[laserfire pulsing]
[alarm blaring] There’s too many. We have to abort!
[yelps] [alarm intensifying]
We’re not gonna make it.
[all yelling]
Whoo-hoo!
Metal to the pedal, miners!
Let’s break some protocol!
[Elita] That’s what I’m talking about, Pax!
[growling]
[grunting]
Whoa! That’s intense.
You can’t win, miner. I see everything!
That’s right, you do.
Except the tower we’re about to crash into.
[alarmed chatter] What’s going on?
[electronic charge]
[Orion] Hey!
What has he done to you?
This is nothing compared to what I’m gonna do to Sentinel.
[Orion] Soundwave, free the prisoners.
[electronic throbbing]
I know how to stop him. Airachnid is the answer.
I’m doing this my way. D!
Yes!
Whoa! [metal clangs]
Whoa-ho-ho!
I got a battle mask!
[grunts]
Elita! Battle mask!
It appeared when this guy tried to…
Knife hands? I have knife hands!
What the…?
[laughs triumphantly]
[deep voice] Badassatron.
Where’s Sentinel? [both grunt]
[Sentinel] You pathetic little twits.
Did you really think that you could knock down everything I’ve built?
It’s over, Sentinel. You can’t escape the truth. [Sentinel] What truth?
That I plucked the cogs from your newborn chests?
Forced you to mine so that I could pay off the Quintessons
and live like a king?
None of that matters! Because the truth…
[mechanical whirring] is what I make it.
Incoming!
Whoa!
[laserfire pulses]
He’s too strong. I have a plan.
We need Airachnid. Airachnid?
We need her memory. Where is she?
Found her! [yells]
Elita!
Do not break her.
Bring her to the broadcast station.
We’ll meet you there.
[strained] Easier said than done.
[yells]
[grunts]
[Orion] I said, don’t break her!
Relax! I’m being very gentle.
Orion! Orion, look! I have knife hands!
I can see that.
I’m gonna cut these guys. Watch. Come here!
You can jab them later. We got to go.
[B-127] Yeah!
[laserfire pulsing]
[mechanical whirs]
[D-16 yells]
[roars]
Uh, excuse me. You can’t be in here.
B!
These are not the bad guys. Why did you cut the door?
What? No, I didn’t… That was an… I…
It was already like that. Right?
Yes, that’s right. That’s right, yes.
Yeah, it was already like… Yes. Mm-hmm.
[console beeps]
[female voice] Attention, Iacon City.
Stand by for a live transmission from Sentinel Prime.
What’s wrong, D-16?
Rise up!
[groans]
[Sentinel on recording] That’s why after I killed him…
That’s why after I killed him, I took his cog for myself.
Cog for myself.
What truth? That I plucked the cogs from your newborn chests?
Forced you to mine so that I could pay off
the Quintessons and live like a king?
What truth?
That I plucked the cogs from your newborn chests?
Forced you to mine so that I could pay off
the Quintessons and live like a king?
I’m working my miners as hard as I can.
I swear I will get you the rest!
I’m working my miners as hard as I can.
I swear I will get you the rest! [crowd gasps]
I’m working my miners as hard as I can, I swear…
Liar!
[crowd protesting]
We trusted you!
Traitor!
Pax, we did it.
[roars]
[grunts heavily]
D!
[both grunting]
[panicked screams]
[grunts]
D-16.
We can lead Cybertron together!
Don’t do this!
[weapon powering up]
[grunts] [weapon powering down]
What are you doing?
It’s over, D.
Everyone in Iacon knows the truth.
So do I!
He took everything from us! I have to do this!
No, you don’t.
Rebuilding Iacon cannot begin with an execution.
He deserves to die! Can’t you see that?
We’re better than this. Don’t be like Sentinel.
Pax,
you need to move out of my way before I move you myself.
D, listen… [yells]
Stop!
[electronic pulse reverberates]
No!
No, no, no, no. Why?
Why did you do that? Why?
[wheezes, sighs]
[panting]
[slowed breaths]
[weakly] D, no.
I’m done saving you.
[straining grunt]
[roars]
[electrical crackling]
The Age of Primes has ended!
No more false prophets!
Follow me and you will never again be deceived.
Rise up!
[crowd chanting] Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
[Alpha Trion] Orion Pax,
your noble sacrifice for the greater good
has proven you worthy in the eyes of Primus.
He entrusts in you
the future of Cybertron
and the Matrix of Leadership!
[crowd clamoring]
I will lead us all into the future!
[electrical crackling]
I…
am…
Megatron!
[Alpha Trion] Arise…
Optimus Prime.
Burn it down!
All of it!
All hail Megatron!
He’s gonna kill everyone. We have to stop him. Come on.
Stop! It’s over.
It’s over when every last one of his followers is dead!
[grunts]
Impossible.
Primus gave you the Matrix.
We could’ve built the future together.
I’ll build it myself.
After I tear down everyone in my way!
[roars]
[pained grunt]
[roars]
[electronic charging]
Ah!
[growling]
[both grunting]
[powering up]
[yells]
[roars]
[panting heavily]
We were given the power to change our world
and you chose to destroy it.
Just like Sentinel.
You have betrayed Cybertron and its citizens.
And you betrayed me.
Go.
Take the High Guard and leave.
You are banished from Iacon.
It didn’t have to end this way.
This isn’t over, Prime.
High Guard, follow me!
[Optimus Prime] The line between friend and enemy
is not as clear as I once believed.
Once it’s crossed, there’s no going back.
Because some transformations are permanent.
[Orion] Hey, Megatronus Prime. Nice.
Oh, yeah. Well, he’s my hero.
[both] The greatest Prime to ever live.
[both laugh]
I’m D-16. Orion Pax.
You ever mine Energon before?
No. You?
No. I hear it’s dangerous.
Well, I’ll tell you what.
You watch my back, I promise to watch yours.
All right.
Thanks, Pax.
A new beginning for Cybertron.
And a new leader.
Yes, about that.
I could use some help from a bot who is better than me in every way.
Who, me? Oh, no, no.
I have a pretty sweet gig working in waste management.
Well, Captain, I do owe you a promotion.
How’s Major Elita sound?
How about Commander?
[chuckles] Even better.
And I’m sorry, B, but I cannot let you go back to sublevel 50.
I may be a Prime now, but I’m gonna need you by my side.
Are you serious? This is the greatest day of my life.
I get to work for the government.
[shimmering tone] Okay. So that’s new.
I’m sorry, what is happening?
[all cheering]
[Optimus Prime] And now we stand here together as one… proving we all have the power to transform, to become who we were destined to be, to right wrongs, to make our world better.
Because here, freedom and autonomy are the rights of all sentient beings.
Here, all are truly Autobots.

They’re almost ready for you, Miss Goldman.
Perfect.
Okay.
First time in television?
Why would you say that?
Oh, nothing.
You’ll do great.
How does my skin look?
It looks perfect.




You got this. Listen, you are the best.
Everything is good. You have nothing to worry about.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay, good.
[ Chuckles ]
Okay, go out there and show these people who you are.
Okay. Okay, ready.
[ Sighs ]
Welcome back.
Joining us in the studio today, aesthetician Hope Goldman.
Hope Goldman is the owner and namesake
of the Hollywood skincare studio Hope Goldman Skincare.
Hope, you really are the American dream.
From a small town,
made it big as a celebrity facialist.
And now you’re launching your very own line of products.
I wasn’t worried, but thank you.
Hmm.
I heard Brett talking about how great your products
are, earlier.
My ears are burning.
Brett, hello.
I just wanted to come and say hi before the taping.
So good to see you.




I have been telling everyone how incredible I think your products are.
I tell you, I am so happy that you are finally getting your own line.
It is time people remember what a pioneer you are.
Mandy, this young lady is the original skincare queen in Hollywood, and soon she’s gonna be a household name.
Alright, I’ll see you out there.
Wait, is it true? Do you make all of this in Italy?
Yes, I do.
I know some would say that creating the highest-quality products and then shipping them from halfway across the world is not the most obvious business plan.
But for me, there really was no other option.
In a business that’s so competitive, how do you stay relevant?
Oh, well, I don’t want to date myself here, but reputation is everything in this business.
And I, um… I don’t see my life, who I am, as separate from my work.
Hope Goldman Skincare, Hope Goldman,
Hope Goldman Skincare. [ Sighs ]
And I bottled it. And I bottled it.
I took everything I learned
from a 20-year career in this business,
and I bottled it.
Wow.
Well, I guess all that’s left is, where do we get them?
Because I know I’m gonna want more.
[ Laughs ]
Well, our official launch is still two weeks away.
So, for now, just through my studio, HGS, in Hollywood.
But coming soon to a store near you.

You’ll love them.
Thanks.
That’s very… sweet of you.

I developed them in Italy.
Nice!
I don’t know if you have your own line, but, um,
all those formulas are copyrighted, though.

That’s very smart.
Yeah, I just… I didn’t realize what you were.
What do you mean?
I didn’t realize you do skin.
Jeff didn’t tell you that?
Jeff? No. No.
Oh.
Well…
I have a very busy day, so welcome.
I mean, it’s an industry, no? So…
Yeah.
Listen, I hope you don’t think I’m intruding on your territory.
[ Chuckles ] Why would you even say that?
I don’t… I don’t think we carry the same clientele.
Do you?
No, no. I don’t think so.
No.
Cool.

Why would you lease the space right across from me
to another facialist, Jeff?
I lease to whoever can pay the rent on time, Hope.
Okay, obviously, there have been some complications
with my product line, and it’s costing me.




Didn’t think of that before?
I had a backer.
I had a silent partner who funded the development
and was supposed to float me right through the launch.
The guy up and disappeared. I mean, it’s not my fault.
Hope, we’re trying to run a business, too.
This is not personal. Okay?
Jeff, come on.
How long have you known me?
Hope…
15 years, Jeff.
And in all that time, have I not been a good tenant?
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, yes, yes, of course. Yes.
Okay.
But it’s not like it was in the beginning.
I have partners now. We need the money.
Okay, listen,
I really don’t think I’m supposed to tell you this,
but I have taped a segment for “The Brett & Kylie Show.”
It’s airing this week.
Things are about to blow up, right?
I’m right back on track here. And I brought you…
…your own product, just for you,
on me, from Italy.
Oh.
Because you’re a part of this, too.
Well, thank you.
Alright.
Listen, you got to kick this Angel guy out, alright?
He’s walking around like he owns the place, Jeff.
Hope, can we deal with your problem right now,
please, first, alright?
Yeah.
I’m gonna have it for you next week.

Aren’t you, like, starting your own line or something?
That’s what Colleen told me.
Come by later this week,

See, that is exactly what I’m talking about.
Everyone is so nice, and they’re living their dreams,
and they’re really doing it.
Well, between you and me,
having your own product line, it’s not all that glamorous.
I mean, the costs are always piling up,
and you always have to bet what you’ve already made
in order to keep up.

I was just breaking up with my ex-husband at the time,

Oh, no.
No, no, no, it’s not bad.

I wanted to be a photographer, right?

for all these different photo shoots.
And there was one photo shoot that I worked on
called “The Seven Faces of Wellness.”
Shut up. No, you did not.
Yes, yes, I did.
I don’t remember you.
You wouldn’t.
I was barely even there. But I really remember you.

I’m serious, it, like, really impacted me for work.
What is work, exactly?
I’m a life coach.

we maintain the exclusive rights to microgravity body chambers,
which can reverse the effects of aging.

Or is that… is that top secret?
Oh…

I would have ignored it myself, honestly.
But [Sighs] now my producers got it.
Oh, Jesus.
And we’d already filmed Angel’s segment,
so they decided to bump your spot and air his.
I mean, just right before the product launch.
I mean, you don’t think this is…
it’s just so perfect, you know, can it really be a coincidence?
Well, I don’t know about that.
No, I’m not gonna argue with you
the timing is unfortunate,
but I-I wouldn’t read too much into it.
But the world and, let’s face it, the Internet
is full of sickos.

I didn’t think anybody would notice.
No, no, no. I think it looks good.
Thank you.
Gives you nice contouring, right in there.
They contour a little bit around the jaw.
No, no, it gives you definition.

Of course you would clock it.
Well…
You are so talented.
It’s no surprise that your products are amazing.
Well, I’m so glad you like them.
And even more glad you’re gonna help
get that segment back on the air.
Okay, thanks again for dinner.
It was so nice after such a rough day.
Oh, it was my pleasure. It was my pleasure.
And I’m gonna do everything I can
to make sure that your segment gets on the show next week.
Oh, Brett, thank you. It’s perfect.

But you and I…
I thought we had a connection.
I feel that way, too. I do. I…
But I didn’t mean to mislead you.
I… It’s just your show’s reach is so large
and the product line and…
Okay.
…this e-mail thing, and I just knew that you…
How about this? Let’s make a little deal.
I’ll get your segment on the show,
and you… will…
What? I’ll what?
You give me a blow job.
Right here in the car?
Or in the house if you want. Honestly, I don’t care.
But this is a pretty good deal, huh?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
We’re right in the middle of something here.

What?

How do you stop? There we go, stopped it.
Okay. [ Sighing ] Oh.

Right?

My mom and I u… used to watch the show together.

Me and my friends used to take that staircase
to school every day.
My parents didn’t give a fuck about me either.
My father beat the shit out of me.
Well, guess what?
“Knock, knock.”
“Sorry, kid, your dad was killed in a car accident.”
[sharp, wheezy laugh]
Sorry. That’s not funny.
[stifling laughter]
[both laughing]
If only those friends could see me now.
When I first saw Joker,
when I saw you on Murray Franklin,
the whole time I was watching, I kept thinking,
“I hope this guy blows his brains out.”
And then you did.
And for once in my life, I didn’t feel so alone anymore.

Hey, Jackie.
You wanna know what I regret most
from being on The Murray Franklin Show?
What’s that?
That I didn’t shoot first and let him ask me questions later.
[Jackie chuckles]
That a joke, Arthur?
Yeah.
[laughs]
All it took was you getting a little old fashioned.
[Jackie laughs]
Thanks, pal.
[Jackie] Let’s get your medication.
Not guilty by reason of insanity
makes no sense in this case.
He murdered five innocent people.
His depraved acts of violence…
[bearded guard] Hey, Fleck.
You’re on the news. …admired by his followers,
not only in our city, but all over the country.
Vandalism, arson…
The judge says you’re competent to stand trial.
I fucking knew it.
And they are still willing to commit acts of violence
in his name.
Now, these people, they believe Arthur Fleck
to be some kind of… martyr.
[inmates murmuring] Well, he’s not.
Arthur Fleck is a monster,
who knew exactly what he was doing.
[inmate] Yep.
[inmate 2] Hear, hear.
And our office will be seeking the death penalty.
Thank you, we’ll be taking no questions today.
[inmate 3] Shit, bro.
[inmates chattering]
You hear that, Fleck? The death penalty.
They’re gonna fry you, Artie.
How does that feel?

To see me.
They wanna talk to me.
[whispers] Hey, Fleck.
I told you before, I set up…
Could you sign my book?
…an exclusive interview next month, right before trial.
Okay, but Kellerman asked me to make a statement now.
He’s letting me go to this movie tonight.
You know, like a normal person. What movie?
What are you talking about?
Come on, Arthur.
Okay. Um…
Yeah, I’m sorry. I have to go. Arthur, I told you…
Okay, let’s move it.
Hang on, Jackie. He’s signing my book.

[laughter] All right, all right.
Well, what did Bill Robinson do?
He danced on the stairs, didn’t he?
Now, I happened to play Oedipus the King on the same stairs.
What’s the difference? We’re all theater.

[Lee] Come on. Can you get up?
Come into the light.
They’re sending me home.
What? Why?
They’re saying you’re a bad influence on me.
What?
This is gonna be good for us.
Now, I can be at your trial every day.
I can see you every day until you get out.

We’re gonna build a mountain.

[Arthur] Can you do it?
Yeah.
[Arthur breathing shakily]
[both panting]
What’s he gonna ask me about?
Besides… you know.
Well, hopefully, about your life in here,
and what the conditions are really like in this place.
He might ask you about Lee.
She’s been out there giving a lot of interviews about you.
And about herself.
Good.
You know, I love her.
She gets me.
Two minutes. Paddy’s ready.
Arthur.
This is a chance for you to show a different side of yourself.
So the public can see who you really are.
And I don’t think you should smoke.
I think it makes you look cavalier.
Okay.
We need to use this time
to show people that you’re human.
They need to understand you were sick. Delusional.
Mm-hm.
You’re not Joker. You’re Arthur Fleck.
[lawyer] Hm?
Don’t worry. You’re gonna be great.
[chuckles]
Arthur.
[chuckling] Are you okay? It’s…
It’s not too late to cancel.
[lighter clicks]
So, uh… you want me to call you Arthur or The Joker?
Mr. Meyers, you know we have an agreement.
You can’t call him “Joker.”
It’s Arthur. Arthur Fleck.
When you’re ready, Paddy.
[exhales]
She has to leave now.
You can watch from behind the glass,
but you can’t be in here.
[whispers] Just be yourself.
We rolling?
Rolling.
[Paddy clears throat]
[producer over radio] Cameras up.
[beeps]
Two years ago, the name Arthur Fleck
hit Gotham like a hurricane.
An unassuming part-time party clown
and struggling stand-up comic,
Fleck committed five horrific murders
in the span of just four weeks.
And now, with hundreds already lining up to get a seat
at one of the first trials ever broadcast live on TV,
Arthur Fleck, The Joker,
is sitting down for his first interview
since that infamous night on Murray Franklin.
And yes, we all know how that turned out.
[sharp laugh]
[Arthur clears throat]
Arthur Fleck, welcome.
Hello.
Take me back to that night onstage with Murray Franklin.
What was going through your mind…
when you pulled out that gun and blew his brains out?
Well, Paddy, um…
I was going through a lot back then. Um…
I don’t really remember much from that night. I, uh…
blacked out, I saw bright lights.
I was having a hard time
knowing the difference between what was real or not.
[Paddy] Oh, please.
You did it on live TV, pal.
Doesn’t get any more real than that.
Paddy, all I remember from that night
is I was gonna kill myself.
On television.
I thought Murray was playing a part in my show.
But he was a bad actor.
So he got what he deserved.
Your last joke, if we can call it a joke,
“You get what you bleeping deserve.”
That’s what you said.
That’s not fun, that’s not funny.
You’re right, I… I should have told a better one.
You’re trying to be funny now?
No.
Do you deserve to die?
The DA is calling for the death penalty.
You just said that you wanted to kill yourself on TV.
So, tell us…
…you still wanna die?
Well, at the time, it certainly seemed a lot easier than living.
Um, but that’s… that’s not me anymore.
That’s not…
That’s not who I am.
That wasn’t really you.
[stammering] No, that’s not right.
Let me get this straight.
That’s not what I meant.
So your defense is,
“It was The Joker who did it.”
An insanity defense.
Okay, I don’t…
I don’t know about a defense.
That this alternate personality,
this killer clown in you killed Murray.
Who am I speaking to now? Which one of you is here?
The poor, low IQ Arthur Fleck?
Or The Joker, who goaded a bunch of no-good punks…
Do you really care?
You don’t.
You’re just like Murray.
You’re just like everyone. You want sensationalism.
You don’t care about…
You just wanna talk about my mistakes.
You wanna talk about the things that I did in the past.
Not about who I am now.
Not how I’m different now.
That’s what we should be talking about, Paddy.
Okay, okay.
We should take a break.
We’re not taking a break.
[Paddy] All right.
Okay, so, tell us… what’s changed, Arthur?
Well, I’ll tell you what’s changed, Paddy.
I’m not alone anymore.
Right.
The girl who was singing. The night you tried to escape.
[chuckles] We weren’t trying to escape.
Miss Harley Quinzel.
You two put on quite a performance that night.
[Arthur] Aww…
She’s really something, isn’t she?
You tell me.
I mean, don’t you think it’s all…

A little much?

[Paddy] We’ll be back with more of Arthur Fleck
after a word from our sponsors.
[man on radio] The murder trial of Arthur Fleck
will begin today.
Assistant DA, Harvey Dent,
is preparing his opening remarks
in what some are calling, “The Trial of the Century.”
[woman on radio] After months of protests,
police will be on high alert, closing surrounding streets,
and setting up barricades for crowds
that could reach in the thousands.
[man] If you ask me, this is what you get
when there’s a complete breakdown of social services.
And don’t get me started on this media frenzy.
All right, Denise, you’re on the air.
[Denise] Thank you for taking my call. Enough is enough.
This idiot doesn’t deserve a trial.
He should be sent straight to the chair.
An example should be made out of him.

It’s my view that there is absolutely no evidence
that Arthur Fleck suffers from multiple personality disorder.
Or that he ever behaved in the role of “Joker,”
as a separate personality dissociated from himself.
[Dent] Doctor, in your opinion,
concerning the work you did on this case,
do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers from a mental disease or defect?
[doctor] No. In my opinion,
he’s not psychotic or unable to test reality.
I think he was sane when he committed these crimes.
In fact, I believe he fakes his mental illness.
[people murmuring]
[judge] Quiet.
[gavel rapping]
And… if he’s, uh…
…faking it, as you say,
then what is your opinion
on the defendant’s mental condition?
I believe he has four relatively minor
and quite common mental disorders
that involve long-standing sadness,
narcissistic self-centeredness, friendlessness,
an indifference to the feelings of others.
This is a very disturbed individual.
But I can’t give you any kind of psychiatric defense for him.
Thank you, Doctor Liu.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
[judge] Your witness, Ms. Stewart.
Thank you.
Doctor Liu, good morning.
[doctor] Morning.
How long did you interview Arthur Fleck for?
About two hours.
About two hours.
It was actually 89 minutes.
Tell me, how can you say for certain,
that Arthur isn’t mentally ill?
How can you be so sure after just 89 minutes,
that this “Joker”
isn’t a distinctly separate and split personality from him?
That that’s not who he is.
Well, I also reviewed all the test results.
Psychological tests, neurological and medical tests.
And in my view, it’s just a performance.
[crowd murmurs]
[Ms. Stewart] Did you read the records
from the Department of Social Services…
…that show that when Arthur was seven years old,
they returned him to his abuser’s home?
His mother’s home.
[pen scratching]
[doctor] I did, yes.
[Ms. Stewart] And when you interviewed him for 89 minutes,
did you ask him why Social Services
didn’t believe the horrific stories
a seven-year-old boy told them
about the physical and sexual abuse he suffered?
[faint, echoing laughter]
No, I… I didn’t ask him about that.
[Ms. Stewart] Hmm.
So you want us to believe,
that after spending just 89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,
and reading through his records and tests
from the same government agencies that abandoned him,
you want us to believe
that you can say with absolute certainty
that Arthur doesn’t suffer from any serious mental illness?
That he didn’t need to retreat into fantasy
and create another identity
to protect that scared, vulnerable, seven-year-old boy
from all the trauma and abuse he suffered?
And that that identity didn’t come out again,
when he was attacked and tormented
by three drunk bullies on the subway?
[three loud, echoing gunshots]
[gun clicking]
“After I woke up this morning,
I thought, ‘Murray, Murray, Murray.’
And then there’s Murray.
Funny, right?
Then I remember Sophie.
I had anoth…”
Objection. Your Honor…
Again, my client’s personal diary is privileged.
[judge] Overruled.
Again, as long as Mrs. Kane limits her comments
to Mr. Fleck’s journals…
But these are my own personal private jokes.
They weren’t meant to be read out loud.
Mr. Fleck. Quiet!
[gavel bangs]
[faint feedback squeal]
[judge] These are your words she’s reading.
And it’s up to the jury
to determine what to make of them.
Please proceed.
Ms. Kane, please continue reading
from the, uh… the highlighted portion.
“Then I remember Sophie.
Had another dream about her. Forgot it.
I almost never dream.
What do I gotta do to remember?”
[Dent] That’s Sophie Dumond, Mr. Fleck’s neighbor,
whom he was obsessed with.
What was that date?
November 17.
Let the record show,
November 17th is the day that Mr. Fleck
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer to death.
The very same day that he shot and killed Murray Franklin.
Now, I know it’s not your area of expertise,
but you have read all of
Mr. Fleck’s journal before, correct?
[Mrs. Kane] Yes, I have.
And in your opinion,
does this sound like a different voice?
Like a different, uh… personality wrote this?
No, it sounds like Arthur.
[Dent] Go on.
He often wrote about his fantasies.
And… the… women he had imaginary relationships with.
And of course, his jokes.
There were always a lot of… these…
these unfunny jokes.
[crowd laughing]
[gavel banging]
[Ms. Stewart] She’s just a social worker.
I don’t think she’s even qualified…
You know, you’re making him out to be a fucking idiot in there.
[reporters clamoring]
He’s never gonna get out if you keep this shit up.
Ask her why she has me sitting so far away from him.
Let’s not do this here. Please?
Do you see all those people out front?
Who do you think they’re here for?
How many T-shirts is Arthur Fleck on?
How many signs?
It’s the Trial of the Century
and she doesn’t even know who her own client is.
What do you mean by that?
Can’t you see how sick he is?
How much help he needs?
He’s not sick.
He’s perfect.
You don’t really think he’s just gonna
walk out of here, do you?
[Lee] Yeah, he’s gonna walk right outta here.
With me by his side.
[reporter] And then what?
[reporter 2] Any further statements?
And then we’re gonna build a mountain.
[reporter 3] A what?
From a little hill.
[reporters clamoring]
What does that even mean?
Are you going to get married?
Move!
[Ms. Stewart] You’re not listening.
We can win this case, and she’s gonna fuck it all up.
No, you’re not listening.
Lee’s looking out for me.
[helicopter whirring outside]
She understands what I’ve been through.
What are you talking about?
We’re from the same neighborhood.
She lost her father. You know… her mom was awful to her.
She had her committed.
So just give her a break.
Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.
I know.
But she didn’t grow up in your neighborhood.
She lives on the Upper West Side with her parents.
Her father is not dead, he’s a doctor.
She voluntarily committed herself
to the hospital,
and then just checked herself out
when she wanted to.
She didn’t check herself out.
Arthur.
I was a bad influence on her, so they separated us.
Did she mention she went to grad school for psychiatry?
[giggling] You wouldn’t get it.
My point is she’s playing you for a fool.
I’m sorry, I just…
I know what it’s like to love somebody.
But I don’t think you can believe a word she says.

Couple of weeks back on TV and already acting like you own the joint.
What the fuck are you two doing sitting on our bleachers?
Who said they’re your bleachers?
Ricky, what the fuck has gotten into you?
[bearded guard] You heard me. Up.
Guess who I just saw out front?
Your little lady friend.
All right, enough. Get up, both of you.
[younger guard] Hey, Fleck, you got a visitor.
See, Arthur? What’d I tell ya?
[older guard] Move it!
[mimics gunshots]
[bearded guard] Every day, this asshole.
[bearded guard] You’re a real fucking whack job, Fleck.
[older guard] Uh-uh!
[gate clangs shut]
[trumpet continues playing]
[door lock buzzing]
[footsteps approaching]
[Lee] Hey.
[younger guard] Five minutes.
How are you holding up?
[sighs]
[lighter clicks]
Is everything okay?
Did you… Did you lie to me?
Sure.
I mean, everybody lies a little.
And you’re not from the same neighborhood as me?
[chuckling] And your… your dad’s a doctor?
You’re rich?
I just wanted you to like me.
Did you really check yourself in here?
[chuckling] Yeah.
[giggling]
That’s crazy.
Just… because you wanted to meet me?
Just to meet you.
You could have just wrote me a letter.
[chuckles]
And said what? I’m nobody.
I haven’t done anything with my life like you have.
Did you really watch that TV movie
they made about me 20 times?
Um… probably more like four or five.
[chuckles]
Was it actually good, or did you lie about that too?
It was great.
[murmurs, exhales]
My lawyer… says you’re playing me for a fool.
I’m no fool.
Can’t you see what she’s doing?
They’re laughing at you in there.
She doesn’t care about you.
I do.
Do you know I moved into your old apartment building
to make us a home for when you get out?
Did your lawyer tell you that?
[picks up cigarettes]
You did?
[lighter clicks]
I don’t want to live there.
[chuckles]
I’m pregnant.

Did you think he was gonna hurt you?
Or your daughter?
[woman] I did, yes.
You believed he was dangerous.
[woman] Well, he broke into my apartment.
You call the police?
No.
His mother told me, uh…
that he’d had problems his whole life, but that he…
wouldn’t hurt a fly.
[dry chuckle]
[scattered laughter]
And…
…was the man who broke into your apartment that night,
was he different in any way from the Arthur Fleck you knew?
I didn’t really know him.
I saw him in the lobby, the elevator a few times.
Like I said, I knew his mother a little bit.
She was really sweet to my daughter.
[Dent] And Ms. Dumond,
why is it that you didn’t want to come here and testify today?
And why did you initially ignore our subpoenas?
Well, after Arthur did what he did,
the press wanted to talk to me about it.
And then I was a character
in that awful TV movie they made, and…
[whispers] It was awful?
Then all these people…
No.
…supporters, I guess, like the people outside,
started showing up at my work and harassing me,
blaming me for what happened to Arthur.
So I was afraid for my safety and for my daughter’s safety.
We moved out of the city.
Well, then why did you finally decide to comply?
Because I should have called the police that night.
Then maybe all those people wouldn’t have been…
Maybe they wouldn’t be dead now if I did.
Thank you. No more questions.
[judge] Your witness, Ms. Stewart.
[Ms. Stewart] Ms. Dumond.
What happened after you asked Arthur
to leave your apartment that night?
He told me he was having a bad day. And then he left.
So, he never hurt or even threatened
you or your daughter?
[Sophie] No.
And did you watch him on TV on Murray Franklin the following week?
[Sophie] I did.
[Ms. Stewart] And did that seem like the same man
who was sitting in your apartment that night?
Did he sound the same or even look the same?
No, I mean, he was… he was wearing clown make-up.
[laughter]
[Ms. Stewart] And while Arthur’s mother
was being so sweet to your daughter,
what was she telling you about her own son?
Um…
She told me that there was something wrong with Arthur,
and that he lived in a fantasy world
and that he had this laugh.
[Ms. Stewart] She told you it was a “dumb laugh.”
That’s what she called it.
“His dumb laugh.”
[Sophie] Yes.
[Ms. Stewart] What else did she tell you?
That she made up a story, when he was a kid.
So that he would feel better about it.
So that he would stop crying,
so that he wouldn’t kill himself.
What was the story?
[Sophie] That he was put on this earth to bring joy.
Something like that. It’s why she called him “Happy.”
[Ms. Stewart] And?
[Sophie] And she…
couldn’t believe that he based his whole life
around this made-up story.
He was a street clown, and he wanted to be a comedian.
[laughter]
[Ms. Stewart] She made fun of him for doing that?
[Sophie] She just thought it was ridiculous
that he thought he could make people laugh.
I mean, she said Arthur wasn’t funny at all.
[laughter]
[voices fading]
[Ms. Stewart] Did she tell you that he had been
in and out of institutions his whole life?
[Sophie] Yes.
[Ms. Stewart] Did she say anything else about him?

[judge] No, you may not.
I want to fire my lawyer.
[man in audience] It’s about time!
Excuse me?
I’d like to represent myself.
[applause]
You’re fired.
Arthur, don’t do this. This is real.
You’d better believe it’s real.
[gavel banging]
[judge] I want order in my court. Order!

Bailiff! Take Mr. Fleck to his holding cell!

[gavel rapping loudly]
This way? Thank you.
Hey, no touching.
I’m so fucking proud of you.
You should see it out there. They’re all going crazy for you.
You did it.
I know, but maybe I should read a law book or something.
You know I never went to high school?

[cigarette crackling]
[radio news fanfare playing]
[man on radio] Good evening, it’s 48 degrees at 6:00
on this Wednesday, November 8th.
I’m Stan L. Brooks and here’s what’s happening.
Shocking developments at the trial
of Arthur Fleck downtown today.
Fleck, the accused killer, also known as Joker,
interrupted testimony
and fired his lawyer Maryanne Stewart in open court.
Then he kissed her goodbye.
Afterwards, Fleck was extensively questioned
by Judge Herman Rothwax.
[judge] The right of self-representation
is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom.
Can you control your emotions, Mr. Fleck?
[Arthur] Yes, sir.
[Brooks] Judge Rothwax reluctantly
approved Fleck’s request to represent himself,
as long as he agreed to stand-by counsel.
A decision that both Fleck’s now former attorney,
Maryanne Stewart and Assistant DA, Harvey Dent
disagree with.
[Ms. Stewart] It’s really tragic.
Arthur believes he has all of these supporters,
but they don’t care about him.
They care about Joker.
[continues on television] He’s not dealing with reality.
He’s mentally ill.
If we could have just convinced him of that
then we would have won this case.
[Dent] Fleck knows what he’s doing.
He knows he’s losing.
We cannot forget that he’s evil.
This is all just part of his plan.
[Brooks] The Arthur Fleck trial will resume on Monday morning.
In other news, Mayor Thorndike…
[cups banging on tables]
[Bullock] There he is.
[inmates cheering]
[younger guard] All right, calm down, everybody.
[bearded guard] Hey, shut the fuck up!
Sit down. Sit down.
Fleck, get off. Arthur!
[Bullock] Yeah, Arthur!
[younger guard] Hey, come on. Get off the table.
[older guard] Get down, Arthur.

After reviewing all the case law that offers precedent,
Jensen v. Superior Court being the most relevant,
I have reluctantly decided
that Mr. Fleck does have the right
as an attorney, to dress himself how he likes…
[loud cheer]
…as long as he doesn’t cause disorder
or interfere with the functioning of the Court.
I will not allow this proceeding
to become as unruly as it is outside.
And I will not let you
turn this into any more of a circus
than you already have.
[scattered laughter]
Thank you.
[judge] Mr. Dent, call your next witness.
The State calls Gary Puddles.
Bailiff?
Will you please escort Mr. Puddles to the stand?
[short chuckle]
[door opens]
[quiet, murmured laughter]
Gary.
Go get ’em. [chuckles lightly]
[bailiff] Please raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you’re about to give is the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
[British accent] I do.
[Dent] Good morning, Mr. Puddles.
[light chuckle]
Thank you for being here.
[Dent] So one last question, sir.
The person who you saw
stab Randall Kleinmanhoffer to death,
are they in this courtroom here today?
Yes.
Can you point him out to all of us?
And… describe his clothing?
He’s… He’s sitting right there at the table.
Wearing a red suit and clown make-up.
[laughter]
[Dent] May the record reflect
the identification of the accused, Your Honor?
[judge] Yes, it will.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
[judge] Your witness, Mr. Fleck.
[sighing deeply]
[Southern accent] Mr. Puddles.
Gary Puddles?
Tell me, sir, is that your God-given name?
Yes.
Really?
[normal voice] Really? Your last name is Puddles?
[scoffing chuckle]
[Southern accent] Why, it sounds like a… a joke.
Well, it’s not.
[normal voice] You expect us to believe that your last name is Puddles?
Puddles?
[laughter]
Mr. Fleck, where is this going?
As I said, I’m not gonna let you turn my courtroom into a circus.
Okay.
But, um, with all due respect, Your Honor,
don’t you think it’s a little late for that?
Don’t try my patience.
[Arthur] Okay. Okay.
[clears throat]
[Southern accent] Mr. Puddles…
earlier this afternoon you testified
that you saw me stab Mr. Kliman Manhoff
in the neck a couple of times. Correct?
Kleinmanhoffer.
Yes, I saw you.
Mm.
And what else did you see that day?
[voice shaking] You stabbing him in the eye,
and bashing his head into the wall,
many, many times.
Yes, but, uh, Randall was a bit of a bully, wasn’t he?
He didn’t deserve to die.
I don’t know.
[scattered chuckling]
Eh, never mind.
Gary, did you catch my act
on The Murray Franklin Show later that night?
No, I didn’t.
No?
Might I remind you that you are under oath?
I was locked up at the police station.
In an interview room.
‘Cause they thought you might come and kill me.
I was the only witness.
They kept me in there all night.
Isn’t that convenient, Mr. Puddles?
That you didn’t see the show, you didn’t see anything I had to say,
[normal voice] I can’t believe it!
Mr. Fleck.
Okay. [clears throat]
[Southern accent] Uh, when you were in my mama’s apartment,
God rest her soul,
when, as you say, you saw me bash Mr. Klannonmen…
whatever’s… head into the wall, “many, many times,”
did I seem crazy to you?
Did I seem like a different person?
Or was I the same old Joker that I always been?
Arthur, don’t do this to yourself, it isn’t you.
[imitating accent] It isn’t me? So you don’t think this is me?
Well, maybe… maybe… you don’t know who I really was.
I never saw that side of you.
[Southern accent] Well, maybe you weren’t looking.
Maybe no one was.
Because nobody knew I existed.
But look around, look at all these people.
Everyone outside. These cameras.
Who do you think they see, Mr. Puddles?
[sniffling] Joker.
Oh, sweet child,
what you have proven here today, is that you are no different
than any of those people that underestimated me.
[normal voice] From Murray Franklin,
to those goddamn fat, stupid guards at Arkham.
They think that they can treat me like trash.
But I will no longer allow you,
or you, or you,
or any of you to keep me down.
I am free!
[crowd chattering]
[all cheering]
[Gary] Why are you doing this to me, Arthur?
What?
Gary, I like you.
I told you I wouldn’t hurt you, and I didn’t.
Not hurt me?
[crying softly]
I couldn’t go back to work.
I still can’t sleep, and I’m scared all the time.
I never used to be scared.
I’m scared right now, here. With you in front of me.
I couldn’t do anything that day.
I felt so small.
[sniffles] I was reminded how powerless I really am.
[Southern accent] Oh… you got a flair for the dramatic.
You are tugging at my heart strings, little Gary.
No more… no more questions, Your Honor.
Do you know what that feels like, Arthur?
[under breath] Oh, fuck!
You were the only one at work who never made fun of me.
You were the only one that was nice to me.
[Gary crying]
I said, no more questions, Your Honor!
[Gary sniffling]
[judge] Very well, Mr. Puddles.
The court thanks you for your testimony.
Please step down, you’re excused.
[judge] Mr. Dent, call your next witness.
We’re not calling any more witnesses, Your Honor.
That is the State’s case.
The State rests.
[judge] Very well.
All right, Mr. Fleck,
at this point, you may mount your defense.
[clicks teeth]
The defense rests as well, Your Honor.
[excited murmuring in crowd]
[judge] Pardon?
Mr. Fleck, you don’t want to put on any defense?
No, Your Honor. The defense rests.
“Th-Th-Th-That’s all folks.”
[crowd cheering]
[judge] All right, all right.
[gavel banging]
All right.
[judge] That’s enough! This is a court of law!
With both sides having rested,
this court will recess until tomorrow morning at 9:30.
[man] You made our case for us, you fucking idiot!
[man 2] You’re gonna fry for killing my son!
[man 3] Burn in hell!
[reporter] Anything you want to say?
[reporter 2] Arthur, will you be convicted?
[photographer] Arthur, over here.
[photographer 2] Let’s see that smile.
Where do you think you stand, Arthur?

[man] There wasn’t anything that she wouldn’t do for a friend.
[woman 3] She devoted her life to her job.
She was always doin’ for somebody else.
[woman 3] Maybe she was tired of being the good girl.
Do what everybody says, follow the line.
And when that caged bad girl was released,
it knew no bounds.




[intense string music playing]
Vicky White was bringing Casey to the courthouse for a mental health evaluation.
[woman 4] Vicky and Casey left the jail this morning, and they haven’t came back yet.
[horn honks]
[man] They didn’t come to the courthouse.
[on recording] We have an inmate who has escaped our detention center along with the assistant director of corrections, Vicky White.
I get a phone call that tells me that Vicky’s missin’.
Missin’? What do you mean, missin’?
I was callin’ all my friends. “Where’s Vicky?”
And I was like, “Oh my God. He will kill her.”
[alert blares]
[reporter 1] A blue alert’s been issued for a Lauderdale corrections officer.
Right now, deputies are searching for inmate Casey Cole White and Vicky White.
A nationwide manhunt is underway right now.

[music fades out]
[intriguing music playing]
[birds singing]
My name is Sergeant Matt Burbank.
I’m the supervisor of the General Investigations Division for the Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Office.
Lauderdale County is in the heart of the Bible Belt.
Just that small, hometown feel that everybody loves that lives in this area.
A lot of the people here have grown up here.
This is the place that people come to raise families.




[woman 1] We’re friendly people.
I mean, I know everybody thinks, the further you get down in the South, you know, you’re rednecks. Rednecks.
But we’re not.
I don’t want people to think because we’re, like, relaxed and laid-back that we’re not playin’ with the full deck.
No, we’re soakin’ stuff in.
I worked at Walmart for 17 years.
And then I went to work at the correction center.
I was very naive.
And when I started workin’ inside the jail, and I seen everything, it was like, “Gosh, you know, all this goes on in Florence?”
[buzzer sounds]
[man 1] Florence Lauderdale County Detention Center.
It is basically a temporary holding facility.
You got people comin’ in for failin’ to pay a traffic ticket.
And you got people comin’ in charged with capital murder.
They may be sittin’ side by side in the booking room.
You got people in there tellin’ you they’re gonna kill you or your family.
Throwin’ urine and feces on you.
It’s a very intimidating environment.
[woman 2] When you first walk in, and you first hear that door shut, it’s like, “Oh my God.”
It’s almost like a… a dark feeling, a cold feeling.
It doesn’t smell like flowers. That’s for sure.
It’s got a smell of body odor.
It’s not a happy place to be.
[Rick] It’s a tough job.
Vicky White did that job.




Seventeen years as the assistant director of operations.
That’s commendable. Very few of ’em last that long.
[Matt] I’ve known Vicky White for approximately eight years.
She was in charge pretty much of everything on the day-to-day operations side of it.
The buck pretty much stopped with her.
[man 2] That woman, she’s one of the hardest workers I’ve met.
Fifty or sixty hours a week, easy.
6:30 every day, Monday through Friday.
Then sometimes workin’ on the weekends as well.
If you had a question about anything, you’d call Vicky.
[somber string music playing]
[door buzzes]
[cell door slams]
[crickets chirping]
[line ringing]
[Vicky] I ain’t parked it today. Not one time.
I’m stressed because I don’t put myself first ever in my life.
I always put everybody else first. It’s just the way I is.
Take time for everybody but myself.
I always got stuff I need to do, but just ain’t enough time in the day.
[whimsical music playing]
When I first started work at the jail, I was like, “Man, I wanna be like her.”
And some of the things that she would teach me is inmates, they’re not animals, they’re human beings, you know.
Inside that jail, Vicky White was, hands down, my best friend.
She treated everybody like they were somebody.
She was like a mother figure that everybody in there never had growin’ up.
I was arrested for domestic violence and assaults.
I was scared to death when I first got in there.
I didn’t show it.
Before I was arrested, I was an officer for CCA prisons.
I was a part of the riot response. Shakedowns, riot situations.
We were more or less the last line of defense.
But when I got to the jail, to the inmates, that meant I was a police.
And in jail, that’s a very dangerous term.
That alone is a very uneasy thing in there.
But Vicky, she was always the soothing, comforting, “It’s gonna be okay.”
She never let you dwell on it.
[Georgineo] I ended up at Lauderdale County Detention Center for domestic violence, third degree.
I was an alcoholic, and I told my dad I was goin’ somewhere.
And he didn’t wanna give me the keys, so I go out there and slash his tires.
I go in front of the judge. He puts me in jail for a whole year.
And that’s when, um, I met Vicky White.
[cell door slams]
[Georgineo] There was this time that I came in actin’ crazy, and this sergeant put me in a chair.
A chair where they tie you down for you to calm down.
She didn’t like that.
She told him to take me off.
She was that person that cared.
[Chantelle] Vicky has no children of her own, but she had that mother instinct. She did.
I was the nurse at the Lauderdale County Detention Center.




Vicky would come to Medical and hang out in Medical with me.
I say, “hang out,” but she was hiding out because everybody was hollerin’, “Vicky, Vicky, Vicky, Vicky.”
And her phone rang constantly.
[phone ringing]
[Chantelle] When her phone would ring, “Hey. It’s Vicky.”
Just super bright and bubbly.
But what people didn’t hear is all of the cursing she did before she answered the phone.
“Oh my God. What do they want? What the blah, blah, blah?”
[sweetly] “Hi, it’s Vicky.”
And we’re like, “Where did that second voice come from?”
[laughs] Like, where’s the swearin’ Vicky that was just here three seconds ago?
It’s like, “Shut up!” You know, “I’m sick of this.”
‘Cause I mean, you know, we had over 300 people in there.
She wanted everybody to think that she could be a superhero.
Vicky just wanted to take care of everybody.
But who’s takin’ care of Vicky?
That’s the question.
[tense music playing]
[indistinct, distant chatter]
[door buzzes]
[camera shutter clicking]
[Rick] The first time Casey White was in a Lauderdale County jail in 2020, he was transferred from the Department of Corrections at Donaldson Prison where he’s already servin’ 75 years for attempted murder, along with a lot of other felonies.
But on top of that, he was facing capital murder charges in our court because he confessed to a murder that was still being investigated.
So he was at our facility, waiting to go to trial.
We considered him a very dangerous person.
[man] Before going to Lauderdale County, Casey White was an inmate of the Limestone County Jail about 11 times in a ten-year period.
[mouse clicking]
[Mike] I was the sheriff of Limestone County at the time.
Lauderdale County is just to the west of Limestone County.
The first time I met Casey, he was probably in his late teens, early twenties.
Casey was an extremely large young man. Casey had, off and on, had girlfriends.
Last time he was in my jail was from shootin’ at his girlfriend.
Oh my God, I’ll never forget that night.
[siren wailing]
Dispatch called and told me we’d had a home invasion and a shooting.
[gun fires]
[dog barks]
Casey shot at his girlfriend and killed her dog.
Casey then went next door.
The neighbor next door said that Casey sticks a gun in his face, tells him that he needs his car keys, which he politely provided to Casey.
Apparently, Casey had pulled into the rest area and decided he wanted to switch cars.
A man and his wife were backin’ out, and Casey tried to get ’em to stop.
They didn’t stop, so he shoots through the back window of the car.
Shot the lady in the shoulder.
At the service station, there was another guy there, and Casey stuck a gun in his face and said, “I need your car.”
The victim starts hollerin’ at Casey, “Hey, man. Leave me my cell phone.”
Well, Casey backs up…
[engine revs]
…gives the guy his cell phone, then goes, gets on the interstate.
[siren wailing]




One of my deputies had spotted Casey in the stolen vehicle and was givin’ chase.
Then he wrecked.
[tires squeal]
[intense music playing]
[officer 1] Put the gun down.
[Casey] I want the sheriff.
[officer 1] Just put the gun down.
[Casey] I want the sheriff.
[officer 1] The sheriff will be here in a minute, okay?
[officer 2] Sheriff’s here now, man. Sheriff just pulled up.
When I got there, he’s got two guns.
One he’s stickin’ to each side of his head.
I’m like, “Casey, put them dang guns down.”
And he’s like, “Mike, call Mom and tell her I love her.”
And I’m like, “Oh, Casey. Nobody’s gonna die here tonight.”
[siren wailing]
[Casey] Sir, I’m gon’ make y’all shoot me.
[Mike] No, no, no, no.
Finally, he agrees if I can get him a Sun Drop that he’ll put the guns down.
[Casey] Can someone go get me a Sun Drop?
[Mike] You want a Sun Drop?
Sun Drop is a soda pop that’s, uh, native to North Alabama.
So I gave it to him. He put the guns down.
And then I put him in my vehicle and carried him to the jail.
You know, he got a 70-year sentence out of all that mess.
[music fades]
[Rick] When he was brought to Lauderdale to face murder charges, an inmate like Casey White should have been isolated in a cell by themselves, but we didn’t have that capability at the detention center because of the crowding issues.
We put him in the A1 cell.
The A1 cell was basically for people that are there for more serious crimes, more violent crimes.
And it’s Vicky’s special cell.
There was actually a sign on the cell that we had to ask Vicky for permission to put someone in that cell.
[Tyler] I met Casey at Lauderdale County Detention Center.
He was put in the same cell that I was put in, A1.
At one time, there were 16 of us in an eight-man cell.
I slept on the floor on a piece of foam because that’s all they had. Overcrowded.
Casey was kind of skeptical of me at first, uh, due to previous employment with the police.
But my story, with the things I had done, and his story, with the things he had done, are so similar, so he related to me.
[Georgineo] When I first heard I was gonna be in a cell with Casey White, my reaction was like, “I’m gonna be in here with a devil.”
[Tyler] Casey, when he loves you, he loves you.
But if you wasn’t in his circle, you better sleep with one eye open.
You better go down the hall because you’re putting yourself at risk.
[Matt] The first time I met Casey, I can remember looking at him and thinkin’ how big he was, at six foot nine.
He was actually very charming. He wanted to talk a lot.
Gives a lot of compliments.
How I dress and trying to build a rapport with me.
And I’m a cigarette smoker, so he was trying to con a cigarette out of me.
But once I turned him down and kind of shut that down, then, at that point, he wanted nothing else to do with me for the rest of the day.
I could definitely see a manipulation side to him, where he was trying to size me up, mentally, you know, seein’ what he might could get away with.
[nurse] My uncle actually had called me, who knows Casey.
He said, “Casey White’s in your jail.”
“Do not be alone with him.”
Next thing I know, he’s got a sick call in, and here comes this huge man named Casey White into Medical.
But he was respectful.
I mean, I’d hang out with him if he wasn’t in jail, you know?
I would.
But in the position that he’s in, no, you don’t truly know somebody.
You know, you don’t ever know nobody until you live with their ass, and, well, that’s the truth.
So, anyway.
[Renee] As I opened up the cage door, Casey White was standing there, and he goes, “Miss Renee?”
And I’m like, “Yes?”
And he’s like, “It’s been five long years since I’ve touched a woman. Do you think I could get a hug?”
I said, “Hell no, you can’t.”
And so I shut the cage door, and I’m like, “Has he lost his mind?”
You have to be very strong-minded as a woman to work in a jail with male inmates.
Some officers come in, and if they’re having a bad day, if they had an argument with their spouse the night before, you know, they come in all droopy-faced, them inmates pick up on it.
“I like what you done with your hair today.”
“Your makeup looks really good.”
That’s why I didn’t wear makeup.
And plus, I sweated a lot when I was down there. [chuckles]
You can’t cross that fine line.
You don’t want to be their enemy, but you can’t be their friend.
I mean, I don’t want to say nothin’ negative about anybody, but some officers care.
Some care too much.
Some want a buddy. Some want to bring drugs in and hand it to ’em.
Some want to be liked so much and respected by an inmate that they’re willing to lose their jobs and go to jail themselves.
[Casey] I’m gettin’ stressed out in here.
[Vicky] You need a cigarette now, huh?
[Casey] Mm-hmm.
I need your fuckin’ help.
[Vicky chuckles] You’re gonna get it one day.
[line beeps]
[Chantelle] Vicky would sit over at a computer, listening to the inmates’ phone calls, looking at their videos, exposing officers that were bringin’ in contraband.
And she was really good at it.
I would go out on a limb to say that she took pride in it, you know?
It made her feel some sense of satisfaction to be able to uncover the truth.
[Casey] I’m so glad the governor got us all tablets so I can call you.
[Vicky] They’re doing that everywhere, I think, with the grants for COVID.
[Casey] Yeah, ’cause they’re cuttin’ our visits out.
I don’t even have no visits no more.
[Vicky] Can you do anything on the tablet?
[Casey] Ah shit, I don’t know.
Hell, as long as I can talk to you once or twice a day, I’ll be all right.
[Vicky] That’s right.
Talk to you a bit, and lay back and listen to the radio and wait on a little bit of time to pass.
[whimsical music playing]
[Tyler] One day in a county is like three weeks in the free world, so I pay attention to everything.
Vicky would open the pen hole, and say, “Hey, Casey. I got your legal mail,” and hand him his envelope.
And he’d hand her a letter out.
Casey started buying, um, love cards from the commissary.
And he’s saying it was going to his mom.
And handed it to Vicky with the mom’s name on it, but there was no address or stamps.
Just the mom’s name in the middle.
[Tyler] He also put letters up in the window to Stacy.
That was his private investigator.
So that kept everybody, like, “Okay. He’s writin’ to an investigator.”
But Casey’d say, “Oh, Ty Lynn…” My middle name’s Lynn.
“How you spell this word?” “Why?”
“I’m tryin’ to write a letter.” “Okay.”
“Gorgeous.” Somethin’ like that.
Why is he writin’ all of these words to his investigator?
That’s when I started to realize it had to be something other than that.
[music fades]
[indistinct chatter]
[Chantelle] We are all very close in the front office.
[gentle music playing]
[gasps] What?
[group laughs]
[Chantelle] Oh my God!
We were all, like, crammed in there.
My desk was right beside Vicky’s.
Sherry was a file clerk then, so she was in the back.
You really become family with the people that you work with.
[Vicky] This girl yesterday I work with, she had this little box.
I come in. She said, “Go ahead and get you some candy out of there before everybody gets it.”
Oh my God, I opened the lid on the box like a dumbass, and a damn spider run up my arm.
About to have a heart attack.
[Casey] You probably screamed and everything, didn’t you?
[Vicky] Oh, I did scream.
[Casey chuckles]
It’s really hard to keep, like, a secret in there because, I mean, everybody is so close together.
[dramatic music playing]
[nurse] It was just like, you know, just girl stuff.
But Vicky was a private person, so I’ve never seen Vicky with a man. Never.
I didn’t even think that she even dated.
[nurse] I remember when I started dating my husband.
My husband is several years younger than me.
And I told Vicky, “Girl, he’s young.”
She’s like, “Ain’t a thing wrong with that.”
“Do you.” And then she tells me that she’s juggling two men at the time.
Vicky was a 56-year-old woman. So I was like, “Well, you go, girl. Do you, sister.”
[Casey] I’m 38 now.
I swear to God, I never knew more of a woman than you.
You’re my queen. You’re my everything.
And I know you’re a couple years older than I am.
I do not care, babe.
I promise, you’re a smokin’ fuckin’ cougar.
And I know for a fact you will never get too old.
You will always be my queen.
[Sherry] It was in December that she had showed me and another coworker two Christmas cards that she had got from each man.
And then one of ’em had two $100 bills in it.
And the two $100 bills were folded really odd.
Like it’s from an inmate.
[Casey] What are you doin’?
[Vicky] Thinkin’ ’bout Christmas.
[Casey] Christmas would be so nice.
[Vicky] I hate Christmas.
[Casey] You’re gonna like Christmas with me.
I’mma go cut our own tree.
Be our first Christmas all up together. We won’t need nobody but me and you.
[Chantelle] I just knew that she had somebody that she enjoyed.
Didn’t know who.
But whoever it was, was makin’ her happy.
[tense music playing]
[birds singing]
[Casey] Damn, I hate you gotta go back to work this week, babe.
I know you don’t want to go back.
[Vicky] I know. I’ll take another one here before long.
[Chantelle] Vicky would always talk about if she won the lottery, she’s gone, okay?
And we’d always be like, “Oh, Vicky, you not goin’ nowhere. You’re not leavin’ the jail.”
[Kylie] “When are you gonna retire?” She said, “Soon, girl, soon.”
“And when I go, I’m going out with a bang.”
Just like that.
And I said, “Girl, you gonna cuss ’em out on the way out the door?”
And she said, “I’m goin’ out with a bang.”
[Matt] On Thursday, April 28, Vicky says, “Here’s my retirement paperwork.”
“It’s effective for the next day.”
She says, “Matt, I can’t do it no more. I’m ready to go. I’ve put in my time.”
And, of course, everybody’s like, “What in the heck?”
[Dylan] I had no idea she was about to retire.
And then all of a sudden, it just kinda snuck up on us.
And I thought, “How’s this place gonna function?”
I was just shocked that she was that burned out.
[music fades]
[crickets chirping outside]
[Casey] Yeah, it’s about chicken time, babe.
Chicken day rolls around quick, don’t it?
[Vicky] You know it does.
[Casey] Yup, the time’s flyin’ by. We’re gonna have fun on our adventure.
Never lookin’ back at little Alabama, and then venture around the world on a sailboat.
[Vicky] I keep tellin’ you, hush, change the subject.
Nobody knows nothin’ unless you say somethin’.
[tense music playing]
[Matt] Friday was like every other normal day.
Just a very light day to me.
And there’s words in law enforcement that you never say.
And that is, “Man, this is an easy day.”
Or, “This is a light day.” And I messed up. I said that.
[Rick] It wasn’t a typical day because the chief deputy and I were going to Birmingham to attend the academy graduation.
[camera shutters clicking]
[Matt] Some of the command staff was out of town at the time.
So we were gonna be shorthanded.
[Rick] Normally, there’d be 11 deputies workin’ a shift, but on April 29th, there were five.
[Renee] Vicky said, “We got about 32 inmates goin’ to court.”
So even though I was off, I came in to help with inmate transport.
I knew she’d be stressed to the max. “Let me help you out.”
You know, “You help me. Let me help you.”
[indistinct chatter]
[gentle music playing]
[man] That was Vicky’s last day. So we had gotten a cake for her.
And we went to the break room. She cut her cake.
Everybody hugged. You know, the whole retirement thing.
But she just seemed more quiet than usual.
And I’m like, okay, maybe she’s like me and just not good at goodbyes.
[clock ticking]
[Tristen] During the party, Vicky seemed a little bit like she wasn’t fully there.
[Matt] When I was talking to Vicky that day, she was lookin’ down at a sheet of paper she had there.
Really wouldn’t want to look at me that much.
Vicky came up to me, and she goes, well, “Let me see your hand. Open your hand up.”
I thought, “Well, what she fixin’ to do? Give me a handful of peanuts?”
So I opened up my hand, and that’s when she gave me her brass.
[crying] So she gave me her brass, and she goes, “I want you to have these.”
And I was like, “Vicky, don’t… don’t leave.”
You know, “I still got a lot to learn.” [sniffles]
[somber music playing]
[Tristen] We went back to work, and Vicky had stopped me and said that she would radio when she needed one of the inmates, Casey, to be brought up to booking and shackled.
And I said, “Yes, ma’am.”
We just went and got him out of the cell, brought him to booking, shackled him.
Cuffed him to the bench and left him just like she’d asked.
And we went back to work.
It was 9:30.
[music intensifies]
[door opens]
[shackles rattle]
[engine starts]
[Renee] We’re down to our last inmate.
I go on out to the van with him, and this inmate’s in for DV strangulation.
So I texted Vicky, and I’m like, hey, I just want someone to know that I was, you know, by myself with him in case something happened.
[somber music continues]
[Renee] But she never replied back.
[Rick] She was bringing Casey to the courthouse for a mental health evaluation.
And sometimes they take a few hours.
When you take an inmate out of the cell, you turn their name tag sideways, so you know that they’re out of the cell.
Casey’s name tag was still sideways.
That’s when we kinda brought it up to people and started conversing about it.
Like, “Hey. It’s been a little bit. Where are they at?”
[Renee] I tried callin’ her, and she didn’t answer.
[Tristen] About three o’clock, I noticed the name tag was still sideways.
Nobody had heard anything. And we were like, “Okay, what’s goin’ on?”
[suspenseful music playing]
[alerts blaring]
[applause]
We all had a great ceremony. And when it was over, we headed back home.
And I started gettin’ phone calls from one of the detention officers.
And he said, “Casey and Vicky White are missin’.”
“She brought him to the courthouse this morning for an evaluation, and they hadn’t been seen since.”
The lieutenant over at Investigations, he calls.
He asked me, am I in the courthouse? I said, “I’m not there. I’m headed home.”
And he just hung up.
[line beeps]
And I could tell something wasn’t right.
[Rick] So we begin an immediate search of the courthouse.
We go to every floor, every courtroom, but she was not there.
Blood dropped out of my face.
I mean, I knew it was gonna be serious immediately.
So we put out a BOLO, which is “be on the lookout.”
[officer] BOLO for missing deputy and Lauderdale County inmate.
Deputy would be Vicky White. Inmate would be Casey Cole White.
Considered armed and dangerous.
[sirens wailing]
[Matt] I’m not understandin’ why all this is transpiring.
I’m drivin’ to the office.
And that’s when we find out that her car may be located in the Academy Sports shopping center parking lot.
So I meet my office partner there with some other deputies.
I pull up to the patrol car. I jump out.
I looked in the back seat.
Sitting in the back seat was a handcuff key.
Casey’s jail-issued shoes were laying there on the floorboard.
He’s not fittin’ through the window divider.
I knew he didn’t have access to a gun.
There was no way that he would have got out of that back seat.
Just immediately, I knew that Vicky was involved.
She had to let him out.
[intense music playing]
Vicky has turned a monster loose on the streets.
What is going to happen next?
You start runnin’ every worst-case scenario through your mind.
I get a phone call from Investigator Burbank.
He tells me that Vicky’s missin’.
She took Casey to court.
I was like, “What kind of idiot would let her do that?”
I mean, she’s here. He’s way here.
I get logged into the cameras, and I’m looking for any kind of sign.
Anything that could tell something.
And I’m like, rewind, rewind, rewind.
[tape rewinds]
[Renee] And then my heart drops.
[intense music playing]
And the coworkers were going, “Well, what is it?”
I’m like, “Look at the video.”
Always, you have to be behind the inmate.
You could see her fingers, how they just glided through.
Vicky was doin’ something that she would fuss about.
And when I’d seen that Casey was behind her,
I thought, “Oh my God.”
She trusted them.
“Vicky, what have you done?”
[Matt] Here he is, a capital murder suspect.
We know he’s done attempted murder.
But she’s walkin’ in front of him. She shows no concern.
She isn’t worried about her safety.
[Kylie] Investigator Burbank is like, “Yeah, we think she went willingly.”
“You’re shitting me,” were my exact words.
“What are you talkin’ about?”
“I don’t understand.”
“No.”
“No. No, not Vicky.”
It was definitely a shell shock.
Kind of felt like some stabs, yet angry, and felt betrayed.
Vicky needed to be in prison. That’s where she needed to be.
And I wanted to be the one to put the handcuffs on her myself.
[music fades]
[birds calling in distance]
[Matt] I immediately had a team of deputies go to Vicky’s residence.
[officer] Can you see in there at all?
[exclaims]
[indistinct chatter]
[officer] It’s empty.
As far… as far as the treadmill.
[officer 2] Her mama.
[officer 1] Here comes her mama, Stance.
[Matt] At that point, they were approached by Vicky’s mother,
who lives just a short distance away, within walking distance.
And she says, “Why are y’all looking for my daughter?”
“Is something wrong?”
[intense music playing]
[Matt] Upon talking with Vicky’s mother,
we learned that Vicky had actually been livin’ there with her mom and dad.
When I told them of what had happened, they were just in shock.
And I could tell genuinely that the family didn’t know that Vicky had done this.
They weren’t in on this.
So I immediately asked if I could search the residence,
and especially Vicky’s room, for any evidence.
[camera clicks]
[Matt] Vicky’s driver’s license, her credit card…
Everything is right there in her purse.
[camera shutter clicks]
[music fades]
There’s a note been left in… Over here, I think.
It’s in a notebook somewhere. Did you look through it?
[Matt] And I’d seen then that Vicky had a lot of money
that was in her checking account until recently,
when she had made a… a big withdrawal.
[tense music playing]
[Matt] Vicky was very detailed.
She wrote down every transaction, every debit card purchase.
And Vicky’s father showed me Vicky’s storage unit paperwork.
So, I’m lookin’ at the paperwork, and there’s a different phone number
than what I knew Vicky to have.
We cross-referenced that phone number to Casey’s prison calls.
We discovered that between November of 2020,
all the way up until February of 2022,
there was over 1,000 phone calls between Vicky and Casey.
[keyboard clacking]
[dramatic string music playing]
[Matt] This was the first instance
we learned of what her burner phone number was.
I was just shocked.
[line ringing]
[Vicky] Hello?
[Casey] Whatcha doin’?
[Vicky] Nothin’. Whatcha doin’?
[Casey] Are you just makin’ a video of yourself?
[Vicky] How am I gonna be talkin’ to you and makin’ a video with the phone?
[Casey] I don’t know. With the other one?
[Vicky] No. That’s only for work.
This one’s only for you.
They had been carrying a relationship on for almost two years.
You know, my heart just kind of sank.
[Vicky laughs]
[Casey] I need to hear you say my name. I need to hear you say you love me.
Just scream “Casey” out.
[Vicky] I love you, Casey.
[both laugh]
[Casey] Oh, you’re gonna be funny, huh?
[automated voice] You have one minute left.
[Vicky] See? You ain’t got but a minute left.
[Casey] I got plenty of time left. I got all the time in the world.
[clock ticking]
[Kylie] She lied. She lied to all of us.
She lied to me.
She lied to my girls up front.
She lied to the sheriff.
She lied to everybody.
Oh, it hurt.
If I just knew she was running around with this dude,
knowing what he could do to her,
I would shake her to try to shake some sense into her.
Say, “Do you know what you’re doin’? Do you know what you’re doin’?”
[music fades]
We have had a warrant issued for Director Vicky White.
Those of us who worked with Vicky White and have worked with her for years,
this is not the Vicky White we know.
I was told by the director of the… the jail
that Friday night, it was like he was at a funeral wake.
You know, we just hope that this has a good ending.
[suspenseful music playing]
[Matt] I knew time was of the essence.
We’re a small agency, so we want all the help that we can obviously get.
We have a meeting with the US Marshals, with the FBI,
with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, tryin’ to figure out who’s gonna do what.
The determination is made we would lead the criminal investigation aspect,
and the US Marshals would lead the manhunt.
[man] The Marshal Service’s job is chasing fugitives.
The Casey and Vicky White case
is probably a once-in-a-lifetime for a lot of investigators.
[Rick] The marshals are arriving.
They’re settin’ up their war room with all their equipment.
[Matt] Vicky knows what investigative techniques we’re gonna use.
She knows how law enforcement thinks. She knows how they operate.
So this is gonna be probably one of the hardest investigations
that any of us had ever worked.
[Vicky] They don’t have my number.
[Casey] Yes, they do have your number.
[Vicky] Well, let me rephrase that. This number.
[Casey] All that stuff is not recorded.
[Vicky] Yes, it is, Mr. White.
I know these things.
You can’t google anything, because anything you google can be found.
You can’t use your cell phone
’cause cell phones pick up on any cell phone towers.
Vehicles have GPS in ’em.
[Chad] Now, you have somebody that’s been in the profession for 20-plus years.
Vicky knows how we chase fugitives.
But we also look for other details.
And by looking at her habits over the last year,
we were really able to glean some clues about what their plans might be.
We were able to look at some receipts over the year leading up to this escape.
She would go to a Walmart to buy groceries.
And when she bought groceries,
she would buy one piece of camping equipment at a time.
She was concealing the purchases that she was making.
[Casey] You already at Walmart?
[Vicky] Mm-hmm.
With as many cars as there is, I might just not do Walmart. [laughs]
[Casey] You going to Target, and you stay out of Walmart?
[Vicky] Yeah, yeah. Too many folks here.
[Chad] In addition to the camping gear,
we also discovered that Vicky had purchased numerous firearms,
including an assault rifle.
[Vicky] Walmart has guns, but they just carry shotguns and BB guns.
[Casey] Go inside Dick’s, see if they got the 44 Magnum, six-inch barrel.
That’s a lot cheaper than the Glock 10.
Me and you get the hell out of Alabama, and we go up to Tennessee.
In, like, the backwoods.
[birds singing]
[Kylie] If it was me, I’d be up there in them mountains back there, you know,
“Appalachian,” or whatever it’s called.
Drinkin’ moonshine and eatin’ herbs, I guess. I don’t know. [laughs]
Mm-mm. I would go deep.
[birds singing]
[Casey] I swear, we ain’t never gon’ be around people the rest of our lives.
We’re going to the fuckin’ wilderness somewhere and fuckin’ build a log cabin.
Anyone gets within 300 yards, it’s gonna be shots fired.
[Vicky] Mm. I wish I could kiss you right now, so bad.
[Chad] Maybe they were living off the grid.
They were hiding in some rural area.
What we really needed to find was their vehicle.
She left her patrol car behind,
and they had to have gotten in a second vehicle.
[phone ringing]
[Matt] And then we received a tip
that Vicky had left her personal vehicle in a grocery store shopping center
in a little town called Rogersville, which is 35 miles from Florence.
Immediately, we began checking that area.
So I’m walkin’ around there, and I see one camera.
It’s actually positioned in an unusual spot.
So I asked the owner, “Does this camera work?”
He says my favorite words ever, “Yes, my camera works.”
After going through several days of footage there at the store,
that’s when we discovered Vicky walkin’ by the camera.
[intriguing music playing]
[Matt] She’s wearin’ a hat. She’s wearin’ sunglasses.
[Rick] And we also saw her out in the far part of the parking lot
around a small SUV that was either orange or red.
That’s all we knew.
If she would have parked just a few feet over,
we never would have, uh, seen none of this.
So, now we have a vehicle.
[Rick] We located a car dealer who had sold Vicky an orange Ford Edge.
So the next step was trying to find that Ford Edge.
And hopefully, with them in it.
But we don’t know what direction, at this point, they left.
Did they go north, south, east, west?
You know, did they go somewhere and get on an airplane?
Did they cross the border somewhere? And we just don’t have a clue.
[music subsides]
As soon as it happened, I…
I mean, I… I smiled. I said, “Brother, you’re finally free.”
“It all worked out, and you’re out.”
[“Outlaw Man” by Jesse Howard and NuBreed playing]
[Tyler] There was a song Casey used to play
by Nu Breed, called “Outlaw Man.”
♪ When the sun comes up tomorrow… ♪
[Tyler] And they kept blarin’ that song.
[Casey] “Outlaw Man” by Nu Breed and Jesse Howard is my favorite one.
It used to put me in my feelings, you know?
[Vicky] It’s a good song.
If you listen to the lyrics of the song, that explained everything about Casey.
♪ So, I hit the road at an early age ♪
♪ Had to learn the hard way How to turn the page ♪
♪ Some people say I’ll see an early grave Or go to prison from a murder case ♪
♪ But I pray I see them pearly gates Though I’m pretty sure that hell awaits ♪
♪ So I hang my head, and I drift away And I pray to God… ♪
[Casey] After my first year bein’ out, will you promise me you’ll marry me?
[Vicky laughs]
[Casey] Oh Lord.
Don’t give no other guy no attention in front of me.
As long as you never do that, I swear I can work with anything else.
[Vicky] Okay.
♪ And I’ll go to my grave As an outlaw man ♪
[door buzzes]
[ominous music playing]
[Matt] Any type of investigation,
the first people you’re always gonna look at
is those closest to the suspect.
In this case, inmates.
[camera shutter clicks]
[Tyler] I was interrogated.
I wasn’t interviewed. I was interrogated.
So I had an investigator ask me if I knew something…
If I knew something, would I have said something?
“If I would have told you, would you have believed me?”
It was a bomb that blew up in their face.
They didn’t know how to get the stuff out of their eyes
to really see what was going on.
[Georgineo] Investigator Burbank cuffed me,
and people there were hollering, sayin’, “There goes Lopez.”
“They got him ’cause he knows about Vicky and stuff.”
I didn’t know nothing about it. I mean, if I knew, I would’ve stopped it.
[tense music playing]
[Matt] As I’m interviewing inmates, one discloses to me
where we think Vicky and Casey’s relationship may have began.
Vicky’s walkin’ down the hall.
Casey’s standin’ there at the window of his cell.
And Casey tells Vicky, “You’ve got a nice ass.”
Instead of Vicky shutting him down,
from all accounts, she was flattered by that.
And that’s probably where it started.
[Vicky] You know that thing you were saying? You said you seen my butt.
[Casey] What made you accept?
[Vicky] I don’t know. I guess I knew you was a country boy.
I was curious, I guess. I don’t know. I thought you was just messin’ with me.
I was like, “Oh Lord. Now what’s gonna happen?”
[Casey] You sure didn’t think you was gon’ fall in love, did you?
[Vicky] No, I didn’t.
[Casey] I didn’t either.
[somber music playing]
Old Casey White is a, uh… a romancer.
I don’t want to call him a “stud muffin.”
[gentle music playing]
[Tyler] When he cares, he cares deeply.
Vicky deals with a lot of men every day. She’s not a fool.
She knew what Casey was saying was sincere.
You gotta realize, her title was assistant director.
You pass a note to a guard like that, you’re looking at extra time.
You’re going to segregation. You’re losing your privileges,
TV, your commissary, your phone…
Casey was willing to give all of that up just to be able to talk to her.
Anytime Vicky’d come down the hallway,
he’d light up like light bulbs on a Christmas tree.
Fridays are casual Friday. Vicky always dressed nice.
A white button-up shirt type, blue jeans, and white shoes is what Vicky would wear.
With her hair down. Her nails were red.
Most of the time, they were red. Real pretty red.
Smile light up the room.
[Casey] Tell me what one of your fantasies is.
[Vicky] Lord, I don’t know!
[Casey] You do know. You’re just bashful and shy.
[Vicky laughs]
[Casey] I want you to tell me.
[Vicky] I always wanted to be a stripper, ever since I was young.
[Casey] Why would you want to be a stripper, babe?
[Vicky] I don’t know. I thought it’d be fun to dance on a pole
and make thousands of dollars.
If I’d been pretty enough, that’s what I’d want to be.
[Casey] You was pretty. You’re fuckin’ smokin’ hot.
What the fuck are you talking about?
[Vicky laughs]
[energetic music playing]
Leading up to the retirement, Vicky was letting her hair down.
So, one of my coworkers was friends with someone
who was opening up a new sex toy store.
And they were trying to get business in,
and they were throwing these little passion parties.
So my coworker told us about it. And we’re like, “Yeah, let’s do it.”
And Vicky decided to go, which was actually very surprising
because she really didn’t do a lot of social activities.
And I’m like, “You’re gonna be there? Oh, we’re gonna have a good time.”
I’d never seen that side of Vicky.
She’s like, “Oh yeah. I’m gettin’ this. I’m gettin’ this.”
Okay.
[Casey] Did you get you some sexy little panties, babe?
[Vicky] I did. Got me some peachy ones, some white ones
And then she takes me over to the leather stuff.
No, no, no, no, no. No.
I mean, that stuff was skimpy.
There is some of that stuff, I did not know what it was.
[Casey] I want a penis pump when I get out.
[Vicky] You don’t need a penis pump. Jesus Christ!
[Casey] One day I want to have real sex with you.
That’s what I want very badly.
[Vicky laughs] Oh my God.
When I first heard the phone calls between Casey and Vicky,
a lot of them were very explicit in nature.
There was some phone sex. Um…
Quite a bit of… of phone sex.
[country music playing]
[Casey] What you got on? Shorts?
[Vicky] Just shorts on today ’cause I ain’t went nowhere.
[Casey] Showin’ them little legs off.
[Vicky] Well, to the dog, I guess. [laughs]
[Casey] I wish I was the dog.
[Vicky laughs]
Don’t start.
[both laugh]
[Casey] Thinkin’ about runnin’ my fingers through your hair and then rockin’ you.
[Vicky] Mm-hmm.
[Casey] I wanna rip that little tank top off you.
[Vicky] Mm.
[Casey] God, babe. I wish I was there kissin’ on your chest.
[Vicky] Me too.
[Casey] Are your nipples hard?
[Vicky] They’re gettin’ that way. You’re such a bad boy.
[Casey] Ah.
I got something else gettin’ hard too.
[Vicky] I bet.
[Casey] Oh, baby.
[Vicky] Baby.
[Casey moans]
[Vicky panting] Oh, yes.
Oh my God.
[music fades]
[tense music playing]
[Matt] As I continued to interview inmates,
we even discovered that they’ve even had sexual contact in the jail.
Vicky would take those inmates and tell them that it was yard time.
All the inmates would go out, with the exception of Casey.
Casey was telling us that he couldn’t go out to the yard.
[Tyler] Casey’d say, “I’m gonna have a call with my lawyer.”
“Gonna be video calling me.”
“Okay, Casey.”
“Casey’s got a phone call. You’re goin’ outside.”
[Casey] Oh my God.
I’m gonna fuckin’ kiss you right there on your lips.
[Vicky] Mm, that feels nice.
[Casey] Sit up on my lap, put your legs around me,
and let me fuck you right.
[Vicky] Oh God!
That A1 cell, it being the cell right there, at the beginning of the hall,
you know, it wouldn’t take Vicky ten seconds to go over there.
I’d never know if I wasn’t watching the camera.
[Casey] You got a banana right there?
[Vicky] Why? You want me to deep-throat it for you?
What? I mean, what? Or…
I just… It blows my mind.
[Vicky] Oh, baby. I want to fuck you so bad.
[energetic music playing]
As we come back in, Vicky would have the door to the hallway not shut,
but it wasn’t open.
It wasn’t closed enough to catch the locking system.
Where she’d have to radio, and them open it.
She’d be standing at the cage.
Casey would have his shirts hung up around the top of the cage.
Uh, clothes, whatever, and they’d be laughing, cuttin’ up.
What can I say? I’m not… I’m not stupid.
Uh, it’s obvious what’s goin’ on.
[Kylie] How did somebody not see her go in the cell?
I don’t see how they could, honestly.
And if she did, that’s disgusting because this place is nasty, but whatever.
May have. I don’t know.
[Matt] We don’t know how many times
they were allowed to have intimate contact with each other.
But we do know that it happened.
[Vicky] Sure was better than what it was the last time.
[Casey] Last time was crazy.
You know how much I love you.
What makes me happy is you bein’ happy. You know that, okay?
Promise me…
[Vicky] I’ll be waitin’ on my husband.
[Matt] Before all this come about,
I knew she was married, uh, younger in her life.
Kind of a high school sweetheart-type situation.
And from all accounts, her and Tommy had a… a great relationship.
But then drugs come into the picture,
so she divorces him.
[Casey] You never did cheat on him in 20 years?
[Vicky] No. I should have.
You ain’t raised to walk away.
After a while, you got to walk away.
[Matt] As time goes along, Vicky gets engaged to another guy.
Then shortly after the engagement, he’s tragically killed in a car wreck.
[siren wailing]
Vicky did not talk about this when she come back to work.
Actually, Vicky come back to work
earlier than what I probably would’ve been able to deal with anything.
[Georgineo] Since her boyfriend died, I think it just went downhill.
She used to tell me that she’d drink every day.
I mean, I could tell she was lonely.
[Casey] You swear you love me more than the first two?
[Vicky] I do, Casey.
My first one was my first true love.
The second was just a rebound love.
Then I swore I’d never do it again.
[Matt] So, at that point, she’s back to where she was, if not even worse off.
Those walls come back up.
The one thing that’s always been there for her is her dog and her job.
That… that’s it, and nothin’ else.
[music fades]
[somber music playing]
[Kylie] I went back to work on Monday.
I went up front with my girls.
And of course, that’s all we can talk about.
It’s what our life revolved around, was findin’ our friend.
And findin’ her alive.
I was scared for her
because Casey was a very dangerous man with a… a past of aggression.
[Dylan] I figured, he’s probably using her to get out of jail.
You know, within those first few days, he might continue to use her.
But after that first week, he’s not gonna need her anymore.
[Chad] As fugitive investigators,
we want to stay as close to that trail, time-wise, as we can.
The quicker that we can close that gap,
the more likely it is for us to make that apprehension.
And we were already days behind.
And we almost have nothin’ to work with.
So we were frustrated that there was not that one piece coming in.
[Chantelle] I thought that they were headed for the border.
I thought maybe they’d gotten a boat. They’ve already hit the water.
If Vicky is leading this plan, she’s going to get as far away as quickly as possible.
[Matt] During the investigation, I did an audit of her computer account.
And that’s when I discovered she had started looking up various names.
Vicky was in charge of unclaimed inmate property.
There were some IDs that she had taken out of that unclaimed property.
We know one of the things that she was looking at
was white males, you know, over six foot five.
Of course, that would be for Casey.
And she was looking at, uh, you know, white females around her age.
[Georgineo] A couple of weeks before the escape,
Vicky sent me a message asking me for fake identifications,
but that was because she was gonna go to Mexico,
supposedly, with a different name,
but I never expected that it was for the escape.
[Tyler] The escape wasn’t something that just happened overnight.
Vicky had a retirement date set, and it all correlated with Casey.
[Matt] Casey was facing a capital murder charge.
And she wanted to try to save him.
[Casey] If they find me guilty, I’m not bankin’ on no appeals.
That’s basically the comment, “death row.”
[somber music playing]
[Casey] ‘Cause I’m a walking dead man, ain’t I?
We all walking dead men.
We all gonna die, just depends on how you gonna use it, I guess.
[Vicky] Don’t worry.
I’m gonna get you out of there before long.
[music fades]
[energetic music playing]
I’m tryin’ to replay everything in my mind.
Did she give any clue that I missed?
[mouse clicks]
[Kylie] I remember that all of a sudden, Vicky put her house on the market.
That’s when I started sayin’, “Something’s not right.”
And that’s when I’d ask her every day, “Girl, where you gonna go?”
[Matt] Vicky’s home sells at auction for approximately $95,500.
She would have made so much more
if she took her time to market the home correctly.
But she was just in a hurry to sell it.
[Renee] She would invite me over when she was tryin’ to get rid of things.
“You want this exercise machine? Come over and get it.”
[Sherry] It was concerning because she was getting rid of everything.
My husband and I went to Vicky’s house to get the tanning bed and the golf cart.
[Joyce] She got everything in order.
She got everything in order.
That, you know… That was organized.
[Casey] Whatcha doin’?
[Vicky] Oh, nothin’. In the garage, fiddlin’ around.
What are you doin’?
[Casey] What are you fiddlin’ around in the garage doin’?
[Vicky] Seein’ what I need to get rid of.
[Casey] Everything’s gon’ work out.
We’re gon’ have our shit figured out by fuckin’ April. For sure.
[Vicky] I know it.
[intense music playing]
[reporter 1] Joining us now, live, is Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton.
Sir, you believe that she and Casey had a romantic relationship.
What is your message for Vicky White this morning?
Vicky, you’ve been in this business for 17 years.
You’ve seen this scenario play out more than once.
Turn yourself in.
[Rick] When you got an escape, prisoners on the run,
you want the public to have as much information as they can get.
[reporter 2] The US Marshals are offering a $10,000 reward
for anyone with information
to help them find these two people, escaped inmate and corrections officer.
We needed that one tip. We needed that one piece of information.
[reporter 2] Here’s a look at those two who are missing right now.
If you see them, call 911.
Casey White, we’re gonna get you. We always do.
Vicky White’s mother says she just wants her daughter to come home,
and come home alive.
A manhunt underway right now in Alabama.
I remember coming to work, and there were news stations lined up.
I mean, it was hard to, like, find a parking spot to get into my job.
Sheriff Singleton says he believes…
[Pilgrim] They’re hoping for tips that will point them in the direction of…
[reporter 3] He says he was as surprised as everyone else.
We had people coming in from everywhere.
[reporter 4 in Spanish] Vicky helped execute the escape.
[in English] They’re in possession of, right now, as far as weapons,
a shotgun, a pistol, and her AR-15.
It was super huge.
[Tristen] It all feels so surreal when you’re experiencing it.
It’s almost like a fever dream that had just happened while we were at work.
And then now, it started going viral across the nation.
[both scatting]
[upbeat music playing]
[pop music playing] ♪ Just the two of us ♪
♪ Just the two of us ♪
♪ Just the two of us ♪
Go, Vicky. Go, go, go.
[Rick] I looked at a few of the posts.
And there were some people out there rooting for ’em, wanting ’em to get away.
We were the bad guys, and they were the good guys.
And I don’t understand that.
But a lot of things in life, I guess, we don’t understand.
She’s an upstanding person, and he’s a criminal.
And they fall madly in love. What do you make of that?
You got this older woman who’s lonely in the jail.
And you got this man.
It’s a disgusting romance novel is what it is, to me.
[music fades]
[Casey] You flippin’ through the channels?
[Vicky] Watching Love After Lockup.
[Casey] Oh, Lord. Don’t watch that show.
There’s some real pieces of shit on there. You know I’m not one of them.
[Vicky] A TV show, I know.
It’s just, it never turns out good.
[Casey] Yeah, I know.
[Vicky] It puts stuff in your head.
[gentle music playing]
[reporter 1] This couple could be anywhere.
So we did a little math tonight, averaging 700 miles driving a day,
which is possible.
They could be, hypothetically,
4,900 miles away from Florence, Alabama, where they took off.
So as you can see there, they could be in Anchorage, Alaska.
[Chad] We weren’t having much traction. We weren’t having a lot of progress.
We weren’t getting any tips about the vehicle at all.
We’re like, “This thing sticks out like a sore thumb.”
[phone rings]
[Chad] But then I get a phone call.
[dramatic string music playing]
Somebody that was watching the evening news
saw the orange Ford Edge.
And they said, “You know, I think I towed that vehicle up in Tennessee.”
[reporter 2] The company had no idea they were holding onto the vehicle
Casey White and Vicky White may have been driving
until they saw it on the news
a full seven days after picking up the vehicle.
This was just east of Spring Hill, Tennessee.
Probably about an hour and a half north of us.
So, of course, the Marshals, my investigators, they head up there.
They start canvassing the area to find out who saw what.
But we quickly realized we’re still a week behind.
[reporter 3] I want to show you pictures.
The sheriff sent these along. Shows that vehicle.
The pair tried to spray-paint it. They didn’t do a very good job.
[Matt] You know, Vicky was very intelligent.
But one thing Vicky didn’t have was street smarts.
She didn’t have the criminal’s mindset. That’s where Casey came in.
Casey sees the Ford Edge, sees it’s a bright orange color.
It sticks out.
I assume he probably becomes upset.
They were making mistakes.
And it was just a matter of time
before we capitalized on one of those mistakes.
[Joyce] The spray-painting. I mean, who’s not gonna notice that?
You can tell where he’s taken over.
It starts to become… scattered.
[Chantelle] It just seemed like that’s when it started getting spotty.
And I guess that’s what happens
when you try to plan an escape with an inmate.
[Casey] I’m gettin’ claustrophobic in this damn cell.
Ready to bounce off the walls. I thought about gettin’ high today.
[Vicky] Oh my God.
[Casey] ‘Cause I got so damn bored.
[Vicky] I don’t understand why you do this shit.
[door buzzes]
[Kylie] Everybody who comes to jail, 70, 80% of them are on drugs.
So, when they come, they start detoxin’.
Or, automatically, they need Medical.
[Tyler] We had a guy come into jail, brought in our cell,
who had, uh, methamphetamines on him.
It happens all the time.
And everybody in there got high.
Casey sober? Wonderful person.
Not sober? Very scary individual.
After sitting up with Casey for three days, talkin’, no sleep.
We wasn’t eating. You don’t eat when you’re on that stuff.
Casey got paranoid.
Casey said someone had stole some of his commissary.
So he jumps up, screamin’,
“I’m a six-foot-nine, 300-pound country boy.”
“Somebody’s finna get stabbed.”
He was threatening everybody. He said he already had 75 years.
He didn’t care about killing somebody in there.
Seventy-five years, he ain’t got nothing to lose.
[Tyler] The guards come in. Everybody’s talkin’ to the guards.
Everybody’s talkin’ to Vicky.
Vicky would get upset when she knew that Casey would get high.
You’d know she was pissed off. It was obvious for him and I.
[Casey] I know I’ve been high, and I know I’ve been trippin’. I’m sorry.
[Vicky] Every time you get high, we go through this. The same thing.
[Casey] So you tellin’ me they not gon’ kill me,
they not gon’ stab me, they not gon’ do nothin’.
[Vicky] I know they’re not! You’re paranoid right now.
‘Cause you did drugs, and you’re high. That’s all it is.
[Kylie] Vicky and I were comin’ out of Cell A1 where Casey was at.
“I can’t stand that mother… neither.”
And I was like… “Okay.”
I never heard her swear before, until she said that about Casey.
[Vicky] Your jealousy, trust issues, and on top of drugs.
[huffs] Fuck.
[Casey] I swear, I’m never doin’ no more ice
because I hate not bein’ able to tell what’s real and what’s not.
Because I do love you with all my heart and soul.
Will you forgive me?
[Vicky] I forgive you, Casey. I’m tired of talkin’ about it.
Vicky was not one to tolerate any kind of drug use whatsoever.
But she had a soft spot in her heart for drug addicts.
She wanted to see them overcome their demons.
[Tyler] That woman was good to us.
I didn’t have much money in jail, but I was never hungry.
Because Casey would order a store, and we were given extra store.
Every week.
Like clockwork.
[energetic, rhythmic music playing]
[Tyler] People got curious about Casey and Vicky.
[Vicky] I had a message on my phone this mornin’ from your ex-cellmate.
It was a picture of him, and it said,
“Tell him to pay me my money, or I’m gon’ talk.”
[Casey] Is that blackmail?
[Vicky] Ain’t nobody gon’ blackmail me! I got news for you and anybody else.
[Casey] Will you…
[Vicky] Listen, I can handle myself. Now them, I don’t know.
[Casey] Just go ahead and block his number till I can get him paid off.
[Vicky] Just pay him his money and be done with it.
[Tyler] If I let somebody else betray Vicky, and it come out…
Not to sound selfish, but you’re shutting down my nicotine, my commissary.
Gonna take away our tattoo gun? Gonna take away all this? Shut up.
I would defuse the curious situations that come about,
to the best of my ability, to keep eyes off of Casey and Vicky.
But it caused a lot of questions amongst some of the inmates.
[tense music playing]
[Casey] If anybody else calls from any other numbers,
just don’t even answer it.
Block their numbers too.
[Vicky] This bitch ain’t scared of nobody.
I don’t give a damn who you are. I ain’t scared of nobody.
As time gets closer to April 29th, Vicky seems more and more on edge.
She starts snappin’ at coworkers.
[Sherry] I knew something had been wrong with her those last two weeks.
She’d have her hand on her head.
She started tellin’ me how she’d went to the doctor.
And I asked Vicky, “Are you dyin’?”
And she started laughing, and she was like, “No.”
And I was like, “It’s not funny, Vicky. I’m being for real.”
I said, “You’re actin’ really funny.”
And she was like, “No. I can tell you this. I’m not dyin’.”
And that was the end of it.
[Joyce] She would call me on her way home from work.
And she’d say, “Joyce, my heart feels like it’s comin’ out of my chest.”
“I can’t do this no more. I gotta step down.”
You know, “I can’t handle all this pressure.”
I told her, “You know, Vicky, it’s killing you. Stress will kill you.”
[Matt] Something was just off about her at that time.
During the investigation,
we learned that this is not the first time Vicky had taken Casey out of the jail.
[tense, rhythmic music playing]
[Matt] Tuesday, three days before D-Day.
Vicky tells one of her employees, “Get Casey White out of the cell.”
“He’s got to go to the courthouse.”
Never really gives him a reason why.
[Dylan] She was runnin’ the place, so if she asks you to do something,
you’re gonna go do it.
Vicky’s everyone’s boss, so we’re not gonna question her.
They’re gone for approximately nine minutes and 35 seconds.
They pull back into the sally port, which is right by the booking area.
As she pulls into the sally port, She sees a patrol car sitting there.
They’re in there in the booking area right now, booking someone in.
She knows that if she walks in with Casey, in that booking area,
the deputies are gonna know that she’s violatin’ the policy.
So she’s gotta come up with something quick.
So instead of going through the booking area,
she brings Casey in through a side door, avoiding booking altogether.
[intense, instrumental music playing]
And Casey is taken straight to his cell, bypassing the deputies there altogether.
[Joyce] You know, she’d already done it once.
She’d done a dry run with him.
Just to see… how this would be, you know.
[music subsides]
That was smooth.
[tense music playing]
[Rick] It’s been a week.
I wish we’d had ’em back in custody within hours.
But, you know, we just have to work with what we got.
[tense music playing]
[Rick] That’s when we get our next break in the case.
A man who was selling vehicles out of his yard
said that Casey White had bought a Ford F-150 pickup truck from him.
[camera shutter clicks]
So now we put the VIN number in the computer system.
And we’re lookin’ for the black truck.
And then Sunday night, I get a call.
[man] I have a car wash on Weinbach.
There’s a truck been sitting in my bay since yesterday at three o’clock.
And it’s got the keys in it. It’s got Tennessee license plates on it.
[Rick] The car wash employee found this pickup truck in his car wash bay
in Evansville, Indiana.
[sirens wailing]
[Rick] So we sent investigators out there to try to locate the car.
[officer] I was the team lead with the US Marshals Service.
And to our surprise, when we arrive in Evansville,
there is media there at the car wash.
[reporter 1] Weinbach Car Wash manager, James Stinson,
saw something and said something.
Tell me what you first spotted here at the car wash.
Yeah, I first noticed a truck stickin’ out of the car wash bay.
It’s always unusual when one’s stickin’ out.
I looked over the truck.
[camera shutter clicks]
[James] Nobody’s in it. I opened the door.
The keys are in the ignition.
We’re like, “What’s the media doin’ here?” He said, “I called ’em.”
Well, we are following breaking news right now.
The escaped inmate from Alabama may have been sighted here in Indiana.
[reporter 2] Evansville is about 175 miles north
of where the orange 2007 Ford Edge had been discovered.
[Scotty] The media discovery of the vehicle
at this point was frustrating.
We were trying to keep that close to the vest.
That truck could be related to the Alabama fugitives.
[Chad] What if Vicky and Casey are watchin’ the news?
We have to act fast.
[tense, rhythmic music playing]
[Matt] We got the surveillance footage as quick as we could.
[Chad] We were able to see the F-150 actually pulling into one of the bays.
[Chad] Casey gets out, putting a gun in his waistband.
And then leaving the wash bay.
And we see a gray Cadillac drivin’ down the road,
and he gets into that car.
And we saw Vicky in the Cadillac.
They were still together.
[Chantelle] When we found out that they had been spotted in Indiana,
we were dumbfounded.
[Dylan] I couldn’t believe that they didn’t go further than that.
The fact that they were only just a few states up, you know.
Why’d they stop there?
[Scotty] We have the picture of the Cadillac,
and we’ve identified that vehicle.
But we have to work quickly before they dispose of that vehicle.
[Chad] And this is where it turns back into old-school police work.
We just put people on the streets.
We were just riding around, looking at some of the known spots.
And lo and behold, we saw a gray Cadillac
backed into one of these hotels in Evansville, Indiana.
[Scotty] The Motel 41, based off where the car is parked,
we’re pretty confident 150, 151 is the rooms we got to contend with.
We get the hotel list.
But when we look at the roster, no names popped out.
We couldn’t make sense of it.
But then we learned that a pizza company had delivered pizza to room 150.
And the delivery driver was able to identify both Casey and Vicky.
They’re still there in Evansville. Now, let’s put a plan together.
[Casey] When I get out, whatever fuckin’ motel we’re in,
all we’re gonna do is hang a “do not disturb” sign on the door.
And you’ll lay your head on my chest.
Wake up, and you’ll be beside of me.
[Vicky] Mm, that’ll be nice.
[Casey] I promise, we can go in a restaurant,
and you’re gon’ wear a strapless lil’ black dress
and lookin’ pretty.
So beautiful and so sexy.
[Vicky laughs] Damn, who are you talkin’ to?
You, you fuckin’… my little pretty wife.
[Vicky] It’ll all work out.
[Casey] I know it will.
Ain’t got no choice but to work out now.
[Chad] Now it turns into a tactical situation.
You know, if they’re gonna run,
if they’re gonna shoot it out, not only is it a threat to us,
it’s a threat to the community as well.
[Matt] We know they have firearms.
You’re running every scenario through your mind.
Casey is not goin’ back without a fight.
Vicky was always the unknown.
[Joyce] And I’d think about Vicky,
I’d seen the side that was nurturing, kind.
But then I’d wonder,
“Will she get in a shoot-out
with police officers?”
I just couldn’t see Vicky takin’ a police officer’s life,
that maybe had three small kids.
I just don’t…
Vicky. That’s not Vicky.
But could she do that?
[Casey] All right. You ready?
[Vicky] I’m ready.
[Casey] All right, Father in Heaven, watch over my wife.
Put a halo of protection around all of us.
Father, let us be happy, show us what to do.
We pray the Lord our soul to take.
In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray, Amen.
[Vicky] Amen.
[Chad] Need a couple units to start headin’ towards
the area of the old Motel 6 on 41.
[Chad] We started to do a slow surveillance.
Trying to give them room till we could get an armored vehicle
and the SWAT team in the area to do the takedown
to hopefully negotiate this in a very safe manner.
But at that moment, one of the Evansville guys calls out,
“Hey, there’s a female comin’ out.”
[officer] It’s the suspects from, uh, Alabama.
[suspenseful, rhythmic music playing]
Casey and Vicky quickly realized that they were being followed.
And the chase was on.
[police sirens wailing]
[Scotty] I’m drivin’, and I could see ’em both.
Casey was cool, calm. He’d been in this rodeo before.
Vicky was very nervous. She was lookin’ around.
Very frantic head movement. She was scared to death.
[sirens continue wailing]
[officer] Get off the radio! Clear the channel! Clear the channel!
In Anchor Industries parking lot.
[Chad] So, he was driving in a large, square area.
It’s our belief that they were making a determination.
“What are we gonna do? Are we gonna get out and run?”
[operator] 911.
[Vicky] Casey, stop!
[Rick] Vicky somehow accidentally called 911.
I don’t know how the call was initiated. Apparently, it wasn’t by OnStar.
[operator] Hello?
[Vicky] Casey!
[Chad] And then they went on to this little grass embankment.
[Vicky] Oh my God! The airbags are gonna go off and kill us!
That’s when our guys started ramming ’em, pushing ’em over into the ditch.
[loud crash]
[Vicky] The airbags are goin’ off!
We should have stayed at the fuckin’ hotel.
Let’s get out and run.
[loud crash]
[glass shatters]
[Vicky screams]
Casey!
[operator] Hello?
[gun fires]
[police sirens wailing]
[engine revving]
[indistinct radio chatter]
[crowd clamoring]
[officer 1] She’s got a gun in her hand!
[officer 2] She could pull that trigger.
[officer 3] All right. Watch it.
Let’s go ahead.
Let’s go ahead and pop this front windshield.
[officer 2] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get back!
[indistinct chatter]
[officer 1] Ready?
[tense instrumental music playing]
[officer 1] Let’s go ahead.
[officer 2] It’s opening.
[officer 3] Careful.
[officer 1] Yeah.
[Scotty] We run up to the car. We grab Casey and pull him out of the car.
[officer 4] Watch out! Watch out!
[Casey] Please check on my wife.
[Scotty] Now they gotta work to get the weapon out of Vicky’s hand.
[Casey] Please tell me if she’s okay. Please. Please.
Please listen to me.
Yeah.
I mean it.
We’re checking on her.
She’s a damn… That’s a good motherfuckin’ woman right there.
Please listen to me.
We’re checkin’ on her, man. Chill.
My wife is the fuckin’ best woman in the fuckin’ world right there.
Hey, as soon as I get you checked out, I’ll go over and check on her, okay?
[officer 1] Front window’s gone.
[officer 2] I can’t even tell if she’s conscious.
[officer 3] She’s breathing.
[officer 4] Somebody got a long stick?
When they pulled her out, I wasn’t sure what shape. She was still breathin’.
And then, when I went over and saw the amount of blood,
I knew it was, uh, most likely a head injury.
[officer 5] Doesn’t look conscious.
[officer 6] She’s comin’ out.
Medic!
[siren wailing]
[indistinct chatter]
[officer 1] I’m gonna take your cuffs off. One hand, all right?
You’re gonna have to sit down on this bed.
You’re not gonna do anything until we tell you to do it. Understand?
[speaking indistinctly]
[officer 1] Step over to your left.
[medic] I’m gonna take a look at you.
[Casey] Yes, ma’am.
Is my wife still alive?
[officer 1] Do what?
[Casey] Is my wife alive?
[officer 1] I don’t know.
[indistinct chatter]
Hi. I’m Dr. Peters. Where are you injured at?
[Casey] My right ear. Or left ear.
My left ear hurts, and I can’t hear nothin’.
Is my wife still alive?
[indistinct chatter]
[officer 1] We don’t know yet.
Man…
[Rick] Vicky White has been transported to the hospital.
Uh, I hope she survives this.
We don’t wish any ill will on Vicky
in terms of her health or her… you know, her well-being,
but she has some answers to give us.
And, uh, hopefully, we’ll have the opportunity to get those answers.
[Matt] Vicky is in the hospital there in Indiana.
I got on FaceTime with, uh, the detective there.
Uh, they showed me her,
and I identified it as, yes, that was Vicky.
Shortly after I identified her is when she passed away.
I did not want Vicky’s family to find out about this incident on the news.
I felt it would be better if I told them in person.
[siren wailing]
[Matt] As I get closer to Vicky’s parents’ house,
I turn the lights and sirens off.
When I got out of my vehicle, Vicky’s mother walks out,
and, I… I… She knew by the look on my face.
My heart sank. I didn’t want to… I didn’t want to tell her.
I didn’t want it to be true. I didn’t want it to be me.
[gentle music playing]
[Matt] Of course, they were heartbroken.
A lot of tears.
Um, just a very sad time for them.
I was sad that Vicky had passed away. Someone who I had tremendous respect for.
Uh, admired, yet had done some… pretty horrible things.
[Kylie] I was at home, I think.
[voice breaking] And then I get a call later that night that Vicky died.
And, um… I just cried.
Sorry.
[interviewer] Oh, that’s okay.
[voice breaking] Her smile, her laugh.
You could hear it all the way down the hallway.
Those 13 months I spent in jail, she was the mother that I never had growing up.
It hurt. It hurt bad.
[sniffles]
[Chantelle] When we realized that it was over,
it was sad. It was really sad.
That was the first time I cried.
That was the first time I cried.
[sniffles]
[reporter] Sheriff Dave Wedding says Vicky shot herself after crashing the truck
she was driving with escaped inmate Casey White.
I would get the audio of the accident.
[recording playing]
[Joyce] I’d put my headphones in, and I would sit there, and I’d say,
“Give me something… saying that she didn’t kill herself.”
[operator] 911.
[Vicky] Casey, stop!
The airbags are gonna go off and kill us. Oh my God.
[somber music playing]
And all I got was those little “oop,” you know.
And you heard the airbags go off.
[Vicky] The airbags are goin’ off.
Let’s get out and run.
We should have stayed at the fuckin’ hotel.
[airbag pops]
[screams]
You can hear the madness in her voice
when she said, “We should have stayed at the mm-mm hotel.”
She was mad at him.
[operator] Hello?
[Vicky] Casey.
Oh my God.
It was so surreal-sounding.
That was just chills.
Just like she’s sitting in the room with me.
Hearing the sirens, hearing the car crash…
These were her final moments.
[Vicky screams]
[gun fires]
[Matt] The shot was almost to the back of the head.
It was a very strange placement.
It almost seemed more like a… a accidental…
a very unique trajectory for a intentional suicide.
I’d like to believe it was accidental, not an intentional suicide.
But according to the reports, the gun went off after the crash.
[Dylan] She knew what it was like to be in jail,
what it was like to be locked up.
And the fact that she would be coming back to this place,
I felt like there’s no way that she would’ve done that.
[Vicky] Casey.
[operator] Hello?
[Vicky screams]
[gun fires]
It just…
I just…
[sniffles]
I just wish she was here.
[sniffles]
I do.
I hate that this happened to her.
And it was his fault.
Tonight, Casey White is back at a maximum security state prison.
This is his latest mugshot, taken today.
[somber music playing]
[Rick] Today’s been a good day. Got him back home.
Got him back behind bars.
[reporter] Did you love Vicky?
Did you love Vicky?
There’s days that I have empathy for Vicky being manipulated like she did.
I have anger with Casey because he put her in this position.
And then the next day, it’s, I’m mad at Vicky.
She betrayed our trust.
She put this agency through so much.
I believe, after looking at everything, Vicky’s love was real for Casey.
Casey didn’t care about Vicky. Not one bit.
If he really loved her, he would’ve never put her in that position.
They’d have figured out another way to work it out.
There’s no way they’re gonna pull off a stunt like this.
And live happily ever after, you know, from now until the day they die.
[indistinct chatter]
[Casey] Is my wife hurtin’? Is my wife hurtin’?
[officer] Just getting into the truck.
[indistinct chatter]
[intense music playing]
[line ringing]
[automated voice] You may hear silence during the acceptance of your call.
Please continue to hold.
[line ringing]
[automated voice] This call will cost five cents per minute.
Thank you for using Securus.
You may start the conversation now.
[interviewer] What did you think would happen after you escaped?
[Casey] We thought we’d never get caught. We thought we had enough cash money.
Went up to everything up there just to find us a place up there… and just get a little rinky-dink trailer up there… for 250, 300 dollars a month, and pay then up for a year right there.
And then pay the electric bill for a year and just stayed and hunkered down up there.
[Tyler] They just wanted to be with each other as long as they could.
They lived every day like it was their last.
[Casey] Whenever we got to Kentucky, and I come out of the shower,
she had me all new clothes laid out on the bed, and…
That was the best night right there ever.
I hugged her and told her I loved her right there, and everything was great.
[Tyler] Vicky White and Casey White truly loved each other.
That’s the best way to describe that. Inseparable love.
[Casey] I called her my wife right there ’cause we was married in my laws.
We weren’t married in the faith laws. We were married together right there.
And I was her husband, and she was my wife.
[Tyler] Casey wanted to be able to be normal with Vicky.
You can’t do that while you’re in jail.
She knew what the risks were. She didn’t care.
She knew what was gonna happen. She didn’t care. It didn’t matter.
She got what she wanted, and that was time with him.
[Kylie] Vicky felt sorry for him.
And then a love grew.
She gave him 11 days of freedom.
She gave him 11 days of being a civilian, of being someone who could walk around in normal clothes, even though they had to hide out.
And it cost her her life.
[Casey] What are you doin’?
[Vicky] Just layin’ here. Daydreamin’. Yeah.
[Casey] Daydream about what, babe?
[Vicky] I don’t know.
[Casey] Tell me the truth. What you daydreamin’ about?
[Vicky] Well, I wish we were somewhere nice and quiet, where nobody would even bother us.
[Casey] That’s what you daydreamin’ about, me and you?
[Vicky] Mm-hmm.
You try putting up with a jail full of men, pissed off all the time, yellin’, cussin’, fightin’.
And colleagues yellin’, hollerin’. Stress, everything she’s going through.
Everything piled on her…
This was that one flicker of joy and peace for her.
She earned the right to be happy.
[somber music fades]
[Joyce] Every woman wants to feel loved.
[uplifting music playing]
I don’t know if it was maybe her age.
If she was going through some type of void in her life.
I… I… I don’t know.
[Vicky] No, I wasn’t the least bit interested in anybody.
But I went to work, came home. I drank every day.
Didn’t think shit about a damn man.
How this happened, I… I still don’t know.
Don’t have an answer for it. But it did, and I’m glad it did.
Well, if she was that lonely, and she really wanted him that bad,
I am proud of her.
I am proud of her for doing exactly what she told me she was gonna do, that was go out with a bang.
And, sister, she went out with a bang.
[Tyler] He wanted a bass boat, and her in her bikini on the front of it.
That was Casey White’s dreams, right there.
[bright music building]
[Tyler] Don’t paint it out like he’s a monster.
Don’t paint it out like she was a fool.
There were just two people, different walks of life, that fell in love.
And I’m gonna leave it at that. That’s exactly what it was.
If you were in the same position, what would you do?
[Vicky] Time’s got me messed up, but the sun’s behind me, thank goodness.
[Casey] God, I wish I was there with you right now.
[Vicky] Me too.
And just think, you finally got a good girl.

[siren blaring]
[siren stops]
[“The Number of the Beast” continues faintly over headphones]
[officer 1] On the ground!
Wait! You hit me!
[officer 1] Get on your fucking face now!
Okay, okay!
[officer 1] Stay on your belly!
What’s going on?
Just stay on your belly!
[car approaching]




108.10-26. Pursuit terminated on Coleman Road.
South side of Fern Creek Bridge. Possible 10-52.
Pursuit? I never even saw you, Officer. I would’ve stopped.
[officer 1] Arms out!
[yells] Arms out like a fucking airplane!
What’s the deal, Ev?
Flaggin’ this?
No.
Picked him up crossing 13.
Lit him up. He tore ass.
If you’re saying I fled, that’s bullshit. I couldn’t hear.
I was behind you two miles! Ran code the whole time.
You tase him?
Nope.
It’s not too late. You want to get tased?
No, sir. I’d just like to know what I did.
Is that your bike?
[man] Yes, sir.
We got a report of a stolen bike.
Can I see it?
You got a mouth on you.
I tried to pull you over, and you fled.
Now come on. Get up.
I’m gonna put my hands in your pockets. I’m not gonna get stuck?
No.




[chatter over police radio]
[Ev] Here.
You have any warrants?
No.
I’m gonna check your backpack for any weapons.
You can’t do that.
I can if it’s in your immediate control.
So take it off.
[Ev] I’d have to uncuff you. That wouldn’t be safe for either of us.
[typing]
[officer 2] No hits. [sighs]
That a star and crescent on your arm?
No, it’s something else.
I lost some buddies, who served in Iraq.
Yeah, so did I.
[Ev] Ooh, what’s this?
[man] It’s not a weapon.
It’s not Chinese food.
I didn’t say it was.
May I look inside?
No, you may not.
Look, I can get a K-9 unit here, or you can give me consent to search.
[man] K-9.
I’ll get Kyle on the horn.
[sighs] I’m gonna have to ask you to take a seat.




Watch your head.
[officer 2] He’s got Ziggy at the vet. Hips are shot!
Call Aurora. See if they can send theirs.
Copy.
How long is this gonna take?
You got somewhere you gotta be?
Yes, I do.
Comin’ from the city, probably 45. Maybe an hour?
Am I under arrest?
You’re currently being detained.
Okay, so if I let you search through it, and there’s nothing illegal, I can go?
Look, I’ll make that determination, but I can say
the more cooperative you are, the better.
[officer 2 chattering]
All right, you can search it.
Steve, 10-22 that K-9 unit.
[cell phone beeps]
Hey, man, I haven’t done anything wrong.
[quiet, tense music playing]
[music stops]
That’s a lot of cash you got on you.
It’s not illegal.
But drug currency is illegal.
It’s a good thing it’s not that.
You delivering it?




Yes.
For somebody else?
No, for my cousin, but it’s mine. I’m posting his bail.
You going to Town Hall?
Courthouse.
Same building.
Okay. Listen, I need to be there before 5:00.
What can I do?
That’s over $30,000 dollars. What’s your cousin in for?
Ten is for bail, and the rest,
we’re going to buy a truck, and haul boats.
[chuckles] I’m not a criminal.
Your cousin is. You didn’t answer the question.
What’s he in for?
Possession.
But it was just weed, and he doesn’t sell, so…
[Ev] All right.
For the traffic violation, I’m gonna let you off with a warning.
Thank you, Officer.
[Ev] I assume you’re aware that when you ride a bicycle,
you’re beholden to the same laws as a motor vehicle.
Yes, sir. Understood.
[Ev] This your address?
Pulled up stakes, but I’ll let you know where I land.
[Ev] Please do.
Now, we’re going to hold on to this money.
We’ve concluded from our investigation that this is drug currency.
No.
[quiet, tense music playing]
[Ev] Or I have you on felony evasion and conspiracy.
Conspiracy?
I… I’m bailing out my cousin and buying a truck.
You and your drug dealer cousin sell it the next day for cash.
It’s money laundering.
Listen, I rode down here to slap some sense into him. Okay?
The cash is legit.
I sold my car. I cashed out my stake in a restaurant.
What restaurant?
Kan Long Chinese. Percyville.
I know that spot. Decent dim sum.
Okay, so that’s where the bag’s from. You can ask ’em.
All right.
We might touch base.
In the meantime, you’re going to get some paperwork in the next 30 days.
My cousin doesn’t have 30 days.
I need to get him out now.
You need to listen.
You’ll get a letter saying you’re being sued for this money
because we believe it’s drug money.
If you answer the charges, and you fight for this money…




This can’t be legal.
…then I’ll come after you with a warrant and put you in jail.
Now if you choose not to answer the civil paperwork,
we win it in default.
You’ll never hear from us again.
How about y’all walk me into Town Hall and we can sort this out?
This is sorted.
[Ev] Come on.
[quiet, tense music stops]
You’re pretty banged up. You need us to call you an ambulance?
Uh, no.
All right, you’re free to go.
[heavy metal music playing on cell phone]
[music stops]
[quiet, dramatic music playing]
[train horn blowing]
[train crossing bell ringing]
[metal detector beeps]
[telephone ringing]
[chime rings]
[woman 1 chattering]
[woman 1] Either of you requesting a jury trial?
[woman 2] No.
[man 1] No, ma’am.
[woman 1] All right. Come back Monday morning.
We’ll put you up first thing.
I would not wear shorts in front of the judge.
[man 1] Yes, ma’am.
[man 2] All right.
[man 3] Posting bail or getting married?
Uh, I need somebody to walk me through this…
You’re injured. How’d it happen?
I got rammed off the road.
[man 3] Oh. Hit-and-run?
All right.
Uh, colleague has a practice across the street.
Come by after the weekend,
but snap some pics while you’re still bleeding. Get a plate?
Uh, it was the cops.
They took my cash. All of it. I was on my way here.
That’s a seizure notice. I can’t help you.
Right. They’re transferring my cousin to state prison?
All our inmates are going. We’re renovating the jail.
Okay, so he can’t go. He gotta make bail.
Help me out here.
You’ve come to post bail
without any money?
You already got it.
This seal is the same as the one on your office door, so…
Which is the same as the watermark on my paycheck.




I am a court clerk, not a public defender.
Is that who I should be talking to?
Yeah, if we had one.
This is Municipal Court. We don’t try felonies.
Indigent defense is not in our budget, nor is employee overtime.
Anything else we pick up during business hours.
This is fucking surreal.
How can I get him out if they took all my money?
[chime rings]
[sighs]
Find some more. Is it a drug charge?
Why would you assume that?
It… It’s just a guess.
Elliot. You got to get to a picnic.
I’ll walk him out.
You sure?
Yup. Say hi to Kate.
Oh, ambrosia…
I had intel there were already two potato salads.
Gingy and Jeff use eggs and bacon. You don’t want to mess with that. Just go.
Thank you. Enjoy the weekend.
You bet.
I’m Summer.
Terry.
So you sure they took all your money?
I mean, I got what’s in my wallet.
Thanks, Cindy.
[country music playing]
It’s called civil asset forfeiture.
[Terry] And it’s legal?
Well, it’s a law.
Supposed to help Feds fight cartels.
But they didn’t find any drugs, so…
All they need is suspicion.
‘Cause the seizure isn’t tied to any criminal charges.
And, here’s where it gets real murky,
Chief gets to keep the proceeds, use it for “discretionary funds.”
Whatever that means.
Someone in permits told me he bought a $900 margarita machine for Cinco de Mayo.
Right, so never mind the, uh… Shit. Which amendment is due process?
Doesn’t matter. It’s the fifth and 14th.
But, when they bring this case, you won’t even be named.
It’s literally going to read…
How much money was it again?
36k.
It’ll read The Township of Shelby Springs v $36,000.
Because your property has no civil rights.
But you can help me get it back?
No.
[chuckles] Okay. Thank you.
I mean, yes, you can fight for the money,
but that’ll take you most of a year, and cost you twice what you’re owed.
[breathes deeply]
What I can do is, um…
[indistinct chatter]
[chatter over police radio]
Okay…
Let’s go.
Can’t talk smack.
Chief has more allies than he used to.
Lost a pretty nasty civil suit couple years back.
Had to clean up his act.
He didn’t do so bad a job either.
Okay, his name?
Michael Simmons. Mike.
And what’s he in for?
Misdemeanor possession.
So Elliot was right back there?
Yeah, but fuck him.
I will say bail’s set really high for that charge.
He had priors?
No. I mean, yeah, but they’re expunged.
He’s had a good run. But before, out east, got into some deep shit.
Ended up a cooperating witness on a capital murder charge.
Dude he helped put away was high up in a gang, so…
Okay, and if Mike ends up in a state facility…
Yeah, they spot him? He’ll get swarmed.
Yikes.
[dog barking]
And the transfer’s Thursday, yes?
Yeah.
Okay, so you got some time.
Can you get more money?
I think so.
Gotta make a call.
Okay. Good.
You know a lot.
You a lawyer or…
Eighteen credits shy of a J.D.
Then the bar. So not for a while.
Cool. So why are you helping me?
Well, it’s pretty clear you need it. [chuckles]
And I know what that’s like.
That’s family. So…
I appreciate it.
I appreciate your appreciation.
[chuckles]
Got a number?
In case I turn something up?
Yeah, but I don’t really give it out.
I’ll check back.
Okay.
All right.
[telephone ringing]
[man] Kan Long Chinese, please hold.
No, it’s Terry.
Can you put me through to Mr. Liu?
[man] Oh. What up, T?
What’s up?
[man] Hang on a sec.
[Muzak playing]
[Mr. Liu] Terry, you already want back in the restaurant business?
[chuckles] Never should have left, sir.
[Mr. Liu] Everything okay?
No, sir. Uh, hit a snag.
Might need a wire to tide me over.
[Mr. Liu] Yeah. How much?
Ten thousand.
[Mr. Liu] When?
Early as Monday. Wednesday would be cutting it close.
[Mr. Liu, sighing] That’s going to be rough.
There’s a Western Union?
Uh, just a post office.
So, uh, money orders,
they’re capped at a grand.
So you need ten.
Yeah, I hate asking.
[Mr. Liu sighs]
[Mr. Liu] All right.
Text Ken the zip, any receiving details, and we can be ready on our end.
You need it, just call.
Okay, will do.
Thank you, sir.
[Mr. Liu] You’re welcome.
[contemplative music playing]
[sizzling]
[contemplative music stops]
[birds calling]
Morning, ma’am.
Hey there, how can I help you?
I need to report a crime.
[officer] Oh, good goodness.
And this was cash?
Yes, ma’am. Uh, do you mind?
Oh, that’s fine.
I ran out of juice. Thank you.
Hey, Chief.
[Chief] Mornin’, Jess.
Okay. Can you describe the suspect?
Uh, big guy.
White, blue eyes, about 6’4″.
Must weigh 250, easy.
You got a good memory.
[Terry] Thank you.
Um, I didn’t get his badge number, but his last name’s Marston,
first initial “E.”
Uh… And there goes suspect number two.
Pardon me. Just a minute.
Yes, ma’am.
[indistinct chatter]
I’ll take care of it.
Sir?
You’re gonna need to leave.
I’d like to finish up.
[Steve] A false police report?
Put your signature on that,
it’s a felony.
Cool.
What’s the charge for being rammed off the road,
shit stolen, threatened with a Taser?
Get up.
While I was in cuffs, by the way.
We can pick this up right where we left off.
Now, now, now, now.
We don’t need none of that.
[Chief clears throat]
Mr., uh, Richmond?
Yes, sir.
I was briefed on this matter yesterday
and whatever your concerns might be,
there is no doubt in my mind that you were the subject of a legal interdiction.
Fled an officer of the law, evaded arrest, suspicion of conspiracy.
[sighs]
You’ve been treated with more than due respect.
But right now you’re facing felony charges if you persist in harassing my officers.
Your officers…
Allow me to finish!
Now you sustained minor injuries after colliding with a patrol vehicle,
and you were offered, but refused, medical assistance at the scene.
Seems like any harm that’s come to you is of your own doing.
Now, currently, and under false pretenses, you are in a secure area.
So I’m going to ask you if you’d be so kind
as to cut off your recording device,
and exit my station.
You betcha.
[cell phone bleeps]
May I at least see my cousin?
You can fuck right off.
I would love to, sir. Just as soon as I get my money back.
Did they even include my statement?
I can fully account for the money, where it was from, and what it was for.
The dim sum spot? We made a note.
You said you’d check it out. Did they?
[Chief] Listen up, son.
We are not litigating this here.
You got every right to fight that forfeiture in court,
but until then,
like I said.
What if I didn’t fight it?
What if all I wanted was the ten for bail? You keep 26k, and I disappear.
I just need him out.
[clears throat]
You mind making a Xerox of this for me, Jess?
Yes, sir.
Yep.
We don’t have one here, but there’s a form
that you can sign to disclaim that currency.
[clicks teeth] That bus Corrections or are we chartering?
Chartering it from Corrections.
Comes when?
Thursday. We break ground Friday.
All right.
We’ll follow up on this.
Don’t exactly have visiting hours around here.
But if you come back here at 9:00 a.m. on Monday morning,
you can see your cousin,
and we’ll put this to bed.
Thank you.
Now fuck off.
[quiet, dramatic music playing]
Thank you.
[exhales deeply]
Yes, sir.
[thunder rumbling]
[thunderclap]
[crickets chirping]
[quiet, dramatic music continues]
[music stops]
[birds chirping]
[distant thunder rumbling]
[“Right Brigade” by Bad Brains playing]
[“Right Brigade” continues faintly over headphones]
[vehicle engine rumbling]
[indistinct chatter]
Shit, you just missed ’em.
Who? What do you mean?
We pulled up our schedule.
Hold on.
You said I could see him.
At 9:00 a.m.
[quiet, dramatic music playing]
You’re three minutes late.
[music intensifies]
Hey, yo!
Yo, Mike!
Hey, Mike!
[pounds on bus]
Yo!
Yo!
Terry?
[Terry] Hey, Mike!
[Mike] Terry!
[Terry] Mike!
Fuck is you doing, man?
I’m gettin’ you out!
Nigga, this a jailbreak?
I’m posting bail!
You gotta request protective custody…
Don’t sweat it. They reduced my charge.
As soon as you process!
Told me I’d be in and out.
I’m serious. They’ll know who you are!
How bad I fuck up?
Just stay low! All right?
All right.
All right!
Oh, shit.
Next time, cuz!
[Terry groans]
[Mike] Come on, T! Come on!
Yeah!
Oh, shit! Come on, T! Come on!
[overlapping shouting]
[person] Come on!
Yeah!
Mike!
[Mike] Come on, T!
Yeah!
[screams]
[Mike] Got that cardio, son!
[dramatic music becomes quiet]
That’s my cousin! Yeah!
[music fades]
[tense music playing]
[telephone ringing]
[man] Hello?
You dropped the accent?
[man] Not open.
What, no more 24/7? Look, I’m gonna need those money orders ASAP.
Just texted you the receiving info.
[man] Sir, those aren’t mine.
Yeah, let me put you through.
But Mr. Liu already…
[Muzak playing]
[Mr. Liu] What the hell, Terry?
Sir, uh, things fell through.
I’mma need to pull the trigger on that 10K.
[Mr. Liu] It’s off the table.
It’s urgent. I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t need it.
[Mr. Liu] I got half a dozen cops here executing a search warrant.
Took my safe. Got dogs sniffing for drugs.
[indistinct chatter on phone]
Wait, how?
[Mr. Liu] You implicated my business in a statement to the Shelby Springs PD.
They contacted Percyville, Percyville came knocking.
I didn’t implicate you. I was accounting for the money in my possession.
I couldn’t have been more clear.
[Chinese chatter on phone]
[Mr. Liu] I don’t doubt that, but you didn’t draft the warrant,
and I’m gonna miss payroll.
I’ll make this right, sir.
[Mr. Liu] Okay. Sure.
[Chinese chatter on phone]
[disconnect tone]
Fuck.
[tense music becomes faint]
[telephone ringing]
Wouldn’t drink the public water.
Hey, were you…
Lemme know when you’ve filled these out, and I’ll walk you over.
You. You’re still wearing shorts.
[man] It’s all I rock.
[Summer] Godspeed.
I’m working.
I’m sorry. These cops, they’re fucking with me.
Yeah. They’re saying the same about you.
They’re transferring him.
He’s on a bus right now.
Sorry to hear that.
You said you could help.
You found something?
I poked around. Got poked back.
So, is there anything…
Look, I need this job, Terry.
You gotta go.
I’d use the back door.
[telephone ringing]
[whispering] Okay.
Fuck!
[tense music becomes dramatic]
[music becomes quiet]
Oh, hey, Terry!
Sorry, there’s too many lurkers. Judge walked in on me going over Mike’s file.
You all right?
Yeah, thanks. He’s fine.
But I flagged a bunch more cases with super high bail.
Every one had an adjournment.
What does that mean?
Not sure. I got busted. But something’s up.
Something’s off.
Misdemeanor defendants don’t sit in jail that long.
Why is that?
It’s expensive. This town’s broke.
Okay, so how do we pursue this?
Look, I sent what I could to an old inkjet.
I’ll grab you the print-outs after work, but that’s it.
I wasn’t playing about my job.
I got a little girl.
Okay. But this could get Mike out?
If it’s a big deal. Maybe.
But if your timeframe’s a day? No chance.
My timeframe’s an hour.
What about the money? You said you could get more money.
That’s gone.
Shoot!
[Elliot] Summer?
Hey, listen, what gets Mike out?
Uh, besides bail, a court order.
But the judge won’t sign one.
[Elliot] Summer, what’re you doing?
So my only hope is dropping 10K on your desk?
His desk. Yeah.
Just catching a smoke! I’ll be right there!
[Elliot] Uh, you don’t smoke.
I’m vaping!
What time you take lunch?
What?
I don’t wanna walk in with a pile of money,
and you be out getting a sandwich.
I’ll have the paperwork ready. Okay?
[panting]
What’re you gonna do?
[Elliot] Let’s go. We’re piling up.
I’ll see ya.
[train crossing bell ringing]
[train horn blowing]
[tense music fades]
[printer humming]
[Jessica] Chief, you’ve got an incoming.
[Steve] That’s your DD214.
What are we looking at?
“Richmond, Terrence James, USMC.”
“Paygrade E-4, Camp Lejeune.”
Here we go. “Primary specialty M-C-M-A-P instructor.”
What’s that?
McMap…
Maybe he’s a navigator?
McMap… Why don’t you google that, Jess?
Rifle expert badge.
Ah, they all get that one.
What was it again? “M-C…”
“M-A-P.”
Let me restart this Wi-Fi.
There’s not much else.
“Released from active duty in ’17.”
Some shit about his dental work.
“Character of service, honorable.”
[tense music playing]
Chief, he’s here.
[Chief] Who’s that? Robby or the concrete guy?
Terry Richmond. He’s out front.
Steve?
“Was on active duty during Iraq, but did not himself serve overseas.”
“Never deployed.”
So, no combat experience.
None. It would say.
[Chief] Good.
My heart damn near skipped a beat.
[typing]
[Steven] How you want to handle this?
[Chief] Aw, why don’t you let me run him off?
You hang back.
[Steve] Got you, Chief.
[tense music continues]
Robby, why don’t you go ahead and call lunch.
[Robby] It’s early. Maybe we…
Yeah, Robby.
Just go ahead and call lunch.
[Robby] All right.
Break! Hey, boys, that’s lunch!
[tense music fades]
Chief.
I’m glad you’re back.
You left before you could see my shit-eatin’ grin.
Oh. Lay it on me.
Aw, it’s not the same if you ask.
Man, I thought we had a deal.
Well, that was the point.
Of what?
Misleading you.
I see.
Do you?
Because the offer you made wasn’t unreasonable.
It was more than fair, as far as the trouble it would save.
Well, it still stands.
So you don’t see.
[object tapping]
It wasn’t the offer you made.
It was the fact that you thought you were entitled to make one.
Well, my intentions weren’t to offend…
Straight to hell with your intentions.
You do not stand in my station in front of my officers and set terms.
I wasn’t aware it was a pissing contest.
Come on now. Hm.
Isn’t it always?
So whatever I say, my cousin…
You could offer me eternal life or a catfish sandwich,
and the answer would still be the same.
Especially since you stopped calling me “sir,”
which is the only thing you had going for you.
Well, see, that’s a courtesy I extend only so far.
One of the perks of civilian life.
[chuckles]
Let’s not go reminiscing about the Corps now.
We both know you never left the base.
Checking up on me.
What were you, motor-pool?
No, put in for infantry, but, uh, they found a use for me state-side.
Now good for them.
[spits]
I’ve had no such luck.
So I guess it’s time you headed on,
and be grateful because if I still had a jail…
[chuckles]…you’d already be in it.
I mean, you got me in a tight enough spot as is.
Both of us, actually.
How’s that?
Well… [exhales]
That’s why I’m here.
I’m running out of letters.
See, it’s, and I don’t mean to reminisce,
but, uh, one thing I can’t shake from the Corps,
acronyms.
Man, we got tons that seared into my brain.
I got an acronym for ya.
Allow me to finish.
That Wi-Fi up yet?
It’s coming.
[typing]
[spits]
The acronym you need to worry about right now is PACE.
P-A-C-E. Ever heard of it?
It’s a planning methodology used for comm systems,
but they found it could be applied anywhere.
Nursing, engineering, parachute infiltrations,
posting bail.
So the P is for “primary,”
that’s me riding into town with my bag of money.
A is for “alternate.”
That’s the deal we apparently never made.
C is my “contingency.”
That’s the restaurant owner you put out of business this morning.
And there it is!
[snickers]
Spot-on too, like you just ate shit.
Anyway, you got me burning through all these letters.
And after this conversation, we already on E.
You know what that stands for?
[Jessica] “Marine Corps Martial Arts Program.”
…What?
“MCMAP.”
“Combat system combines hand-to-hand, close quarters…”
[tense music playing]
Oh-oh.
I think he’s on the Wikipedia page,
teaching jiu-jitsu to the 6th Marine Regiment.
Okay.
[Jessica] “Team building…”
“One mind. Any weapon.”
Call in any units on patrol.
[Jessica] Yup.
Here come your peeps.
[Steve] Chief!
You wanna honor that deal or do I gotta transition to E?
[Steve] Put some distance between you!
[tense music swelling]
[gun slides]
[music continues swelling]
Ah. Let’s not do that.
[Steve] Hey! Hey! Hey!
Let go! Move back!
Okay, okay. Don’t shoot.
Move the fuck away from him!
All right. Okay! Okay. Okay.
[grunts]
[tense action music playing]
[people shouting]
[man] Hey!
[Steve gasps]
[gasping]
[people shouting]
[Steve coughs]
Okay. Real quick. We’re gonna stay cool and go inside.
You’re fuckin’ nuts!
Lead the way. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Go! Tell them to safety their rifle.
Why would I?
He’s quiet with good form. If anyone’s gettin’ anyone killed, it’s him.
As long as I’m not the one dying.
I’m scared of him shooting me, Chief.
I’m not waiting on him to go first, and you’re between us.
All right! Go ahead and point that thing the other way!
Go on now! It’s just a dust-up!
[Terry] Safety that weapon!
Open the door.
[Chief] We’ll handle it! We got it!
[tense action music continues]
[Terry] Move.
[telephone ringing]
[music becomes quiet]
All right, center of the room.
[ringing continues]
Sit down.
[ringing continues]
[ringing stops]
[telephone clatters]
Sit down or I sit you down.
[breathing deeply]
All right, where is she?
We’re the only ones here. Skeleton shift.
Bullshit.
Sims is here. You got two on patrol.
All right, if this goes fast, it’ll go as well as it can.
But if you slow me down… it’s gonna suck for everybody.
Jess, come on out!
Come on out, Jess!
Let’s just get this over with.
Sorry, Chief.
Don’t you apologize.
All right, weapon on the deck.
Let’s go.
All right, restrain them.
Their cuffs, not yours.
I’m assuming my money’s in the property room.
You got keys?
Right hip.
[Terry] Go.
Stop.
Go.
[breathing deeply]
Yeah.
Hey, just make sure it’s my…
[footsteps]
Goddamn.
[inhales deeply]
Count out 10K.
Deal’s a deal.
Feel free to round up though.
[Jessica] Okay.
Go ahead.
Stop there.
Is there a back exit?
Side one to the lot, but you still gotta exit out front.
I’m holding on to your weapon. I’ll surrender it to Sims once I’m safe.
You ain’t ever gonna be safe.
Now, I’m assuming those boys out there are forming a redneck SWAT team.
Can you and I agree we both want to avoid gunfire?
Of course.
[bullets clattering on floor]
[cartridges clatter]
Their lives are in your hands.
[tense music continues]
Now your cuffs.
[handcuffs click]
[Jessica] It’s all over now.
[tense music fades]
Chief says back to work.
[man] Where is he?
On QuickBooks setting up your payroll.
Go on.
[insects chittering]
Someone should string that motherfucker up!
Don’t get ignorant.
This man is a veteran going through something difficult.
We had a misunderstanding, but it’s over.
Now you go on about your business, and let us go about ours.
[Terry] Hey.
Thanks for that.
It was for me. Not you.
[tense music playing]
Disable the perp locks, please.
Not my cruiser.
I can pull over, figure it out.
Just keep going. I’ll shoot the glass out if I have to.
I see they got you rolling in an old-ass Crown Vic
while they get brand-new Chargers for themselves.
Chief says we need a diversified fleet, in case of a recall.
[police siren blaring]
And I like my Crown Vic.
Hey, you stay cool, I’ll stay cool.
[siren shuts off]
[siren blaring]
What’s that? What’s that mean?
Code 4.
I’m okay. You’re okay.
[man over speaker] Go ahead, 105, just passed you.
Code 13…
No 10 codes. Speak so I can follow.
Be advised. Officers need assistance at the station.
Suspect has left the scene. Now on foot, headed northbound on 13 at Mount Ida.
Suspect is…
I said I’d surrender it. Keep going.
I’m not telling my officers until I know.
Unarmed… but considered dangerous.
[tense music continues]
[man over radio] We need all units on that search. Gets pretty thick out there.
[man 2] Copy, 106.
I’ll drop them on the paint a mile up the road.
Copy.
Sorry.
[man 2] 105. Come in.
105. Do you copy?
[siren blaring]
[tense music continues]
[tires screeching]
[tense music becomes faint]
You good?
[whispering] I’m good.
Good.
Good afternoon.
Posting bail or getting married?
Defendant is Simmons, Michael R.
You want to count it out, Elliot? I’ll get the judge to sign.
[Elliot] All right.
[Elliot clears his throat]
[man chatters indistinctly]
Need you to sign this bail form right here.
Bail form.
[faint tense music continues]
[Summer] I double-checked. Yes, sir.
Um, how was your weekend?
You’re over.
Hm?
This is yours.
I’ll get you a receipt.
Refund if he shows for his hearing. He’ll owe a levy for court costs.
Not a problem.
[Elliot] Oops! Wrong one.
Summer, are these yours?
Oh, yeah. I was just, uh, going over a few cases.
Shouldn’t leave these out.
[Summer] Let me just shoot this over.
[indistinct chatter]
[people shouting]
Did it go through?
On our end, yeah.
Did you hurt someone?
Barely broke the skin.
Think he’ll get out?
Think they’ll send me to where he’s at?
Was that your plan?
I ran out of plan.
[Marston] On the floor! Now! Move!
[music intensifies]
[Steve] Down on the ground!
[officer 1] Slow! Hands!
Knees!
On the ground!
Get those hands up!
Here we fucking go!
Don’t! Oh my God!
[Steve] Taser!
Tell the chief I said…
[Marston] On the floor!
Oh, my Lord!
[officer] Get back!
[men shouting]
[Taser zapping]
[Marston] Get down!
[Terry groans]
[Steve grunts]
[Summer] Stop!
[men shouting]
Gimme your hand!
Don’t hurt him!
[officer 2] Get his arms.
[Steve] Gimme your hand!
Hands! Gimme your hands!
[Elliot] All right, take it easy!
[officer 2] Stay down!
[Steve] Stop moving.
Stop fucking moving!
[Elliot] Take it easy!
[Marston] Cuff him!
A deal’s a deal.
[officer 2] I’ll call medical.
[officer 3] Yeah…
He stays put.
[officer 4] Holding’s full.
[officer 5] Put him in the catacombs.
[tense music fades]
[woman] Open.
[light clicks]
[indistinct chatter over police radio]
Reactive.
[Marston] So he’s good?
Probes were out when we got here. No real tissue damage.
ECG was good. No cardiac history.
You ingest any drugs today? Meth, anything like that?
[Terry] Mm-mm.
When was your last tetanus shot?
I don’t know.
You should get one.
He’s good.
More worried about the mold in here.
This was a jail?
[Marston] It’s a catacombs. Storage now.
[water dripping]
You up for a drive?
Don’t I need to get in front of a judge?
Someone else wants to see you first.
[quiet, tense music playing]
[Marston] Do yourself a favor.
Hear him out.
[object thuds]
[metallic object thuds]
[car door shuts]
[Chief] They confirm which one?
[Marston] Yup.
[Chief exhales deeply]
[quiet, tense music continues]
[Chief] You know the thing about a pissing contest?
Everybody gets piss on their boots.
Do you agree with that?
Sure.
Today should have never happened.
If I’d known who you were, maybe it wouldn’t have.
May I ask where we’re going?
[Chief] Give me a minute here. Okay?
[Terry] Okay.
[Chief] When you came in today and gave yourself the tour, what’d you see?
Not sure how I’m supposed to answer that.
[Chief] You can be frank.
I saw a shit ton of cash, and enough weaponry to support a rifle platoon.
[Chief] That cash is our operating budget for the next two quarters, if that.
All of it legally seized, all of it going back into the community.
Like the margarita machine?
[Chief, chuckles] Heard about that, did you?
Well,
sometimes we… we all need a little something for the morale.
What you saw in that cage was our survival.
Out of six towns, we’re the last in the parish with our own force.
Got us doing traffic control, responding to medical.
Evan here took, I don’t know how many… How many reports you take last year?
Close to 600.
[Chief] Six hundred. [chuckles]
And they cut our budget.
Say they’re going to issue bonds, but they never do.
Crawl up our ass for police reform, but they won’t fund it.
Not only do we got to find our own money, we got to turn a profit.
Those weapons…
Did you get a good look at ’em?
The multi-launcher and the flashbangs… You ever heard of a dazzler?
Non-lethal.
[Chief] Yeah, we have to call ’em “less-lethal.” Liability purposes.
But yeah, we, uh, outsource them to the other PDs.
Protests, riots, suicide by cop.
Civil unrest, it’s a growth industry around here.
I don’t know about the Marines.
Yeah. We got an acronym for it.
[Chief] Well, what is it?
E-O-F, N-L-E.
Escalation of Force, Non-Lethal Effects.
[Chief] That’s the new thing.
De-escalation.
Save the perps from themselves. Everybody lives to fight another day.
Well, I’m all for it.
How about you?
For what?
[Chief] De-escalation.
[quiet, tense music continues]
Sure.
[Marston] Come on out.
Nice and slow.
All right, turn around.
26,000.
Still in there.
What is this?
What’s happening?
[Chief] Well, I’m gonna tell you.
But first, we’re gonna have to take those cuffs off of you
because you shouldn’t be wearing them when you hear this.
And given what happened today, you need to be very, very careful.
As will we.
Understood?
Turn around.
[handcuffs click]
[Chief clears throat]
You can face me.
We’re at Samaritan Hospital Center.
Your cousin is being Med-evaced here as we speak.
He’s coming from the infirmary, so we’re a little ahead of ’em.
Is he alive?
He was attacked.
Just out of processing.
I do not know his current condition.
When I talked to Corrections, they said he was…
stabbed up pretty good.
[shouts] I fucking told you!
Now, you see, that’s what we can’t be hearing from you right now.
What do you want to hear from me?
[Chief] Well, this is tough to take in, so
maybe just focus on that.
We could be throwing blame around here all night, okay?
Just because you was right, doesn’t make us wrong.
Right now, you gotta choose
between a bag full of money
and our deepest sympathies,
or 30 years minimum.
Or worse, if you can’t stay in control.
To what? Walk away?
[exhaling] You had a plan, right?
Paid in full. More than makes up for the bail you’re short.
I didn’t ask to get paid off.
[Chief] Son, I’m trying to make you whole.
Now go haul boats, or sell that truck for cash.
Whatever you decide to do, you do it damn far from here
because if you enter this township again,
this’ll go another route.
Aw, come on, this smells way off.
Not for a steaming pile of shit.
[helicopter whirring]
That’s your bird.
This is your deal.
All you gotta do
is nothing.
What am I gonna say?
You say “okay.”
[breathing deeply]
[exhales deeply] Okay.
Hey, you want to keep that nice.
Seller’s expecting you.
You don’t take possession by tonight,
I’m going to assume the deal’s off.
Then we go that other route.
You’re free to go.
[tense music continues]
[helicopter approaching]
[car door closes]
[car door closes]
[music stops]
He’s not really in the system yet.
Pops up as “in transit.”
He put you down as next of kin.
So I’m seeing if you can claim the remains here, or if they have to go back.
Coroner might put the body on hold since it was a homicide.
So I guess just stay in touch with our office until they figure it all out.
Could you take those off?
Sure.
[faint, moody music playing]
[moody music swelling]
[music becomes faint]
All set?
Yeah.
[music stops]
I salvaged your bike.
If you want to swing by my house and grab it.
Pawn it.
It’s worth a couple grand.
I see ’em.
It’s not what you think.
Be smart. No way he just lets me go.
He’s worried about November.
Makin’ a run for Sheriff.
That’s real, what I found.
I don’t know what this is.
Case records that don’t match up with the bail schedule.
And I don’t care.
There’s dozens.
Look, Terry, I…
I know now is not the time.
It’s just we don’t have any…
When we cross to the next town, we should get some food.
Can’t remember my last meal.
Someone wanted Mike in jail.
The others too.
To what end? I don’t know. They all end up walking.
But they were in for 90 days.
No more. No less.
Waiting to be arraigned on charges that don’t carry jail time.
I don’t doubt what you’re saying.
But if the revelation is that your Bama-ass town is corrupt
and my cousin and whoever else got fucked over,
I don’t need convincing.
I didn’t come here to set things right.
I just wanted Mike not dead. Yet here we are.
They can’t just run you off.
Never. It’s called tactical retrograde, and I got off easy.
Well, I can keep digging…
Respectfully, no.
All I need is transpo the fuck outta here.
And if that’s no longer cool, you can drop me off at the next bus station.
Bus station’s past where we’re headed.
[quiet, tense music playing]
[music fades]
[forest creature sounds]
[sighs]
Whatever I say
is gonna fall short.
You got something to write on?
Think it over.
Text me something profound.
Thought you didn’t give this out.
Yeah, well…
All that aside, back there,
I appreciate you giving a shit.
Well, I appreciate your appreciation.
[“Hard Time Killing Floor Blues” by Skip James playing faintly]
[music plays more loudly]
[car door shuts]
[car engine starts]
You here for the dually?
I am.
Yes, sir.
I’ll let you take a look at her.
[“Hard Time Killing Floor Blues” ends]
[tense music playing]
[faint clattering]

[man] Move. Don’t touch shit.

No.

Terry!
Mm… I’m in trouble.
[music becomes dramatic]
Summer!
Hey!
Summer!
[water running]
[dramatic music fades]
It’s okay.
That’s the proof. I’ll tell you that right now.
What about another city?
Another state?
It’ll still go on my medical history.
So, you’re gonna risk dying?
Wasn’t enough to hurt me.
How do you know?
I can tell.
So what’d they put in you?
The dosage? You an “almost doctor” too?
I fuckin’ know, Terry.
I go to a hospital, it gets reported.
And if it’s reported, the judge…
Everything gets unsealed.
I’ll never get back custody.
They’ll tell my little girl.
I can forget about taking the bar.
[beeping]
What’s that?
That’s your oatmeal.
How can they hold it against you?
I’m sure a lot of lawyers struggle with that.
[Summer] Addiction?
Yeah.
Related crimes of moral turpitude, not so much.
I pawned a ride-on mower that wasn’t mine.
My father-in-law’s.
Mm-mm.
My husband petitioned for divorce soon as I was charged.
Took our kid.
He was just waiting to pounce. I was a wreck.
Didn’t contest anything they put forward.
Couldn’t afford a lawyer.
Um…
I just sat there in court
listening to how horrible a mother I was.
Made a pretty solid case.
Hey. Come on now.
You know what’s funny?
When I took the mower… [exhales]
…it had this snowblower attachment on it.
I left it on when I rolled it out the shed,
and that’s what bumped the value from petty theft up to grand theft.
I’m a felon
because of a lawn mower accessory.
What?
Nothing. Go on.
Tell me.
I was just going to say that blows.
[chuckles]
Go on. I want to hear this.
That’s about it.
The judge took pity on me.
I promised to stay clean.
He sealed everything up, and I went to work for the court.
Figured however things turned out,
I’d never not be able to defend myself again.
Yeah, I hear that.
What can I do?
You were right.
You should go.
You should grieve.
Mm.
I’ll back off.
Show up to work like nothing happened.
Hey.
You sure you’re okay?
How blue are my lips?
Not very.
Then, yeah.
[“Wayfaring Stranger” by Neko Case playing]
All this talk of defending myself.
Here I am.
It’s the right move.
Taking fuel away from the fire.
You gotta focus on your girl, you know?
I won’t forget about Mike.
I’ll get this truck off your lawn.
[dramatic music playing]
[exhales deeply]
Morning.
Morning, Alex.
[Alex] Morning, Ms. McBride.
[Alex sighs]
[alarm beeps]
Oh, hey. You’re supposed to go see the judge first thing.
Okay.
[dramatic music continues quietly]
[man] Those were the terms of your employment, were they not?
[telephone ringing]
[Summer] They were.
And you understand I can only act on the information given me.
But it’s not true.
That’s not me.
I believe you.
If there’s nothing to it, then there’s nothing to it.
Test’s not gonna lie.
If you wouldn’t mind emptying your pockets, please.
Oh, and leave your purse. Victoria here will take you in.
You all right in there, hon?
[sobbing quietly]
[quiet, dramatic music continues]
[music becomes tense]
Shit.
[indistinct, faint chatter]
[dispatch 1 over police radio] We’re good up here.
[dispatch 2] 106, you’re clear.
[truck engine idling]
[Steve] Kill that ignition!
[engine shuts off]
Now toss your keys out the driver’s side.
[keys jingling]
[tense music fades]
My hands good?
Sure.
Ten and two.
Your lights broken?
How do you mean?
It’s just you waved me down.
So I’m wondering if something’s wrong with your lights.
Something wrong with your GPS?
It was an emergency.
You respond to emergencies around here now?
It was just a friend.
Yeah?
She turned out to be more trouble than you.
It was a false alarm.
You’ll never see me again.
That conversation was had.
Chief handed you a winning lotto ticket.
And you just tore it up.
We got a dozen witnesses saw you storm the station.
Your prints are all over the property cage,
and there’s a missing bag of money.
I’m guessing, we’ll find it right here in this truck.
Feeling smart now?
No, sir.
I’ll give you credit for catching the lights though.
Pretty sharp.
These new cruisers,
you run the lights…
the dash cam starts recording.
Gun!
[gun fire]
[groaning]
Fuck!
[gunfire continues]
[dispatch 2] What are we doing?
[music becomes dramatic]

[Steve] Help!

[officer] Shots fired with that buckshot!
[Steve groans]
[zapping stop]
[officer] I got him! Clear out!
[zapping resumes]

[truck engine starts]
Get out of the truck!
[gunfire]
[gunfire continues]
Move!
[intense dramatic music playing]
[groans]
[gunfire]
Hit the fuckin’ tires!
[gunfire continues]
[music fades]
[rapid gunfire]
[children shouting excitedly]
You know you can’t be here,
not without a heads-up.
[tense music playing]
We didn’t call anybody.

[grunts loudly]
Shit.
[cell phone vibrating]
[Summer] Terry? Terry?
You should stay off the phone. I was coming to you.
[Summer] Don’t. I just got a visit from the police.
Yeah, me too.
You okay? You hurt?
[Summer] They came to warn me.
Said I should leave town. Stay away from you.
[coughs] Yeah, solid recs. Who was it?
[Summer] A friend, same one who followed us yesterday.
That was for me, not you.
[dog barking]
You mobile?
[Summer] Yeah. Yeah, I’m packing up.
All right.
That Volvo, you own it?
[Summer] Only thing in my life that’s paid off.
Okay.
Um…
Bring your title. I got somewhere we can go.
[Summer] Should I pick you up?
No. I’ll be good.
[panting]
[taps head]
All right.
Don’t write this down.
[Chinese folk music playing]
[telephone ringing]
Okay.
Summer?
[people chattering]
Kan Long Chinese, go ahead.
Uh, no brown. White, fried, or sticky only.
Uh-huh.
Uh, shrimp’s a dollar more.
[rap music playing over speaker]
Two soups.
No. Special soups.
[man] Another round of beers, table six.
Uh-huh.
[man] And what’s your address?
[knocks]
[blues music playing over speaker]
[Summer] Oh my God, are you shot?
Yeah. Summer, this is Mr. Liu.
Hi. Sorry, I would have driven faster.
They had Quikclot, but I wasn’t sure if it was the gauze or the sponge, so
I got both.
Burners?
[Summer] Yeah.
Thank you.
And I got coconut water. If you want some.
No, I’m good.
[Mr. Liu] Ah, traveled down pretty clean.
Still a couple fragments,
but I’ll leave it in if you’re gonna be moving around.
You should be at a hospital.
Look who’s talking.
This is different.
Yeah, well, Mr. Liu was a field medic in Korea.
Oh.
Thank you for your service, sir.
[Terry] He’s Chinese.
Fought for the other side.
Well, it’s good we can all come together.
Make sure he finishes his.
Hm.
[chatter on radio]
[Terry] Walk me through it.
[slurping]
I want everything.
[Summer] It’s just I didn’t get that far.
It’s what’s keeping me alive.
[quiet, dramatic music playing]
They just tried to kill you.
And no one’s called in the cavalry.
With what they could pin on me, should be a federal task force dropping a tac team
on the roof right now.
[radio shuts off]
They’re keeping it quiet.
Because of what you found.
So…
From what I pulled, it’s clear they’re manipulating defendants’ jail time.
What’s driving it? I don’t know. That’s what they’re protecting.
They got your folder, right? So it’s not just what you pulled.
No. Folder’s why they’re onto us.
The case files are public record. Anyone can look ’em up.
Okay, so is that enough to take to the press, start a ruckus?
No, holding them for 90 days, hiking bail,
the individual acts aren’t necessarily illegal.
It’s discretion of the court,
so the judge can double your fine for tracking mud on his floor.
So he’s in on it.
When the cases do reach his bench,
he lets ’em off, mostly full dismissals.
If anything, he’s pushing back.
So we get kinetic. Find out what he’s pushing against.
We’re over the town line.
We should keep going.
Yeah, well, maybe you.
These officers are quiet because they’re vulnerable.
Whatever window we have,
I guarantee you they’re closing it.
They do,
I’m dead.
Won’t matter where I am.
You think me too?
Bottom line up front?
I don’t see how they let you walk away.
Who knows?
Maybe they’ll cut you a deal.
Hell, they let me walk.
Then I pulled you back in.
Yeah, and it’s good you did.
When they sent me on my way…
I was grateful.
Like my whole life was back ahead of me. I even heard Mike telling me it was okay.
How I train,
what I teach, most of it comes down to self-preservation.
So I guess I just acted accordingly.
Anyone would.
Yeah, but the chief didn’t give me an out.
I gave him one.
And that wasn’t Mike’s voice.
That was mine.
This shit’s far from okay,
and these cops might end up on top.
I’m not pretending here, but they sure as shit don’t get any more outs.
And Mike,
I hope he’s in a better place.
I don’t know enough about the afterlife to trust in it, so while I’m here,
and he’s not,
I gotta haunt these motherfuckers myself.
All right?
What about taking fuel away from the fire?
Mm. It’s different now.
How so?
We’re the fire.
[dramatic music continues]
[Terry] What about your friend on the force?
Think he’d be willing to talk?
Never said it was a he.
“He,” “she” fine.
Codename “Serpico.”
Would they talk? Take this to the state police?
No, they were clear on that.
Warning me was risky enough.
You all right?
[distant thunder rumbling]
Just have a feeling tonight’s going to get pretty dark.
Isn’t that what nights do?
[man] Okay, three, two, one,
go!
[all cheering]
[man] First is Isaiah!
Ryan in second, Jack’s in third, Henry fourth!
Nice heat, guys!
All right, let’s bring those back…
Hey, buddy!
Summer!
How’d you do?
Bad. I got taken out in the fourth-place runoff.
Super cool.
At least you made it yourself. You’re mostly competing against other dads.
Ben. Go cheer.
[quiet, dramatic music playing]
[man] All right, let’s see if we can get a new leader out there! Ready?
[Summer] We know they’re locking defendants up and letting them go.
We have no idea why, but our local PD is willing to kill
to keep us from finding out.
They came into my home!
What do you want me to say?
That you’re on the right path?
Are we?
[distant thunder rumbling]
I can’t answer your questions.
Fuck this guy.
It’d be aiding and abetting.
Whatever it is you’re doing, I can be named an accessory.
I don’t report you the minute you leave, it could be seen as a failure to act.
If I inflict pain before you answer, does that help from a legal standpoint?
Listen. Even if I wanted to, I don’t have the answers to give.
Okay? And that’s by design.
I don’t want to know.
No, that!
You!
You’re a fucking tumor, Elliot!
[quiet, dramatic music continues]
If I did…
If I did want to know…
I would have some questions.
Yeah, like what?
Like how far back does it go? What you found.
Mostly recent, less than two years.
Mm-hm. Why is that?
I searched bail records. Uh…
Probably didn’t dig deep enough.
Or?
That’s as deep as it goes?
And if that’s true, I would also wonder…
[distant thunder rumbling]
…was there something that coincided in that timeframe?
Something pertinent?
The civil case?
[Ben] Dad!
Isaiah won again. Can we go now?
[Elliot] Yes. [clears throat]
Hey!
That case, the settlement, it put pressure on the police.
Oversight.
Turned things around.
Did it?
It’s been quiet ever since.
So there’s your big question.
You got no answers from me.
[Summer] Lawsuit didn’t turn things around.
Turned them upside down.
[distant thunderclap]
[dramatic music becomes very faint]
[chatter on TV]
[man 1 on TV] Well, this is a surprise.
A commission in the cavalry, too, huh?
[cat meows]
[man 2 on TV] I see you got the commission you were after.
[man 3 on TV] You know these men, Rader?
[man 1 on TV] Yes, sir, very well.
This one, Stuart, comes from a rich slave owning family in Virginia.
[floor creaking]
He called you a lying renegade once, and I jumped him for it…
[TV audio stops]
[ominous music playing]
It’s okay.
[music becomes tense]
I’ll talk.
[cat meows]
Jesus.
There’s no need to hurt me.
Where’s Summer?
[Terry] Don’t know.
I was gonna ask you.
Elliot called.
I need for her to hear this.
[Terry] Who? What? Where?
No time for why.
She’s owed it.
[cat meows]
Would you believe I was protecting you this morning?
I’m sure you convinced yourself.
I was afraid they’d do worse, and I’m deeply sorry about your brother.
[Terry] Cousin.
Your cousin.
[breathing deeply]
So why is he dead?
Bishop v The Town of Shelby Springs.
You’re familiar with it?
Just some of the fallout. That the chief was named personally.
Illegal search snowballed into a wrongful death.
Settlement damn near bankrupted the town.
His department was deemed uninsurable.
Got a year to modernize, clean up its act.
And it did, on paper.
Uh-huh, on paper.
So you sell out your bench to protect Sandy Burnne?
Hell no, we wanted him gone.
The reform mandate was a ploy to shut him down,
hand over our contract to the state police.
There was no money for him to comply.
So he goes out, gets his own.
[judge] Did 100,000 in forfeitures his first month.
He cut you in on it?
Me and every other taxpayer.
They seized my cash. You told me it was legal.
It is. That’s what I don’t get.
That money flows back into debt service, payroll, public works.
That’s Christmas lights in December,
fireworks on the Fourth of July, and a nice little old tax cut on top.
Everyone holds their seat.
But how are a handful of misdemeanor defendants a threat to all this?
And boil this shit down… quick.
Liability.
Traffic stop goes wrong,
an arrest gets rough,
anything that might put the department in legal jeopardy, they’ll flag the case.
Kick the charges down to misdemeanors.
So it stays in town court.
Where there’s no public defender to contest the bail or adjournments.
Keep ’em in purgatory.
[Summer] For 90 days.
Why is it always 90 days?
I guess if I was smarter, I’d have mixed that up some.
Didn’t want to hold them a day longer than we had to.
The retention period?
Shit.
The hard drives at the courthouse.
That’s it?
That’s it.
Their dash cam videos. It’s part of the settlement.
We store their footage. They can’t access it on their own.
But you can?
[Summer] Only if it’s deemed evidentiary.
If it’s not held or subpoenaed for 90 days, it’s deleted.
[tense music continues]
All right.
What’s on Mike’s video?
What’d they do to him?
Enough to get us sued.
Have you seen it?
No.
Let me guess. You don’t wanna fucking know.
Wouldn’t matter if I did.
Lose another lawsuit and it’s disincorporation,
Shelby Springs disappears. Swallowed up by the parish.
Y’all gonna leave me like this?
What, alive? Yeah. For now.
You knew Judy.
What would she think about all this?
What you’re doing to me.
Well, if she knew what you did…
she’d want to watch.
These yours? Need to take one before we go?
Mm, I’m good for the night.
This is his wife’s… and it’s empty.
Oh, shit. I forgot to feed the cat.
[Summer] Shit.
Would you mind?
Hey, how many did you take?
Where’s the fucking cat food?
[siren blaring and stops]
[chatter over police radio]
[tense music continues]
[car door closes]
[zipper zipping]
Hey.
[siren blaring]
[sighs]
You think he’ll make it?
[music becomes quiet and dramatic]
Yeah.
Hey, it’s cool if you gotta step back, start thinking about your girl.
She never left my mind in there.
Him, Elliot,
this whole fucking town couldn’t form a single spine between them.
If I do get her back… When you get her back.
She’s gotta know I got one.
[sighs] Where do you keep the drives?
Basement.
The catacombs?
Yeah, but there’s an alarm.
Yeah. And moisture.
And a lot of rot.
[quiet, drama music ends]
[quiet, ominous music playing]
[crowbar clatters]
[Terry] You got it?
[Summer, whispering] Yeah.
I love it down here.
You can smell the history.
[Terry] Where to?
[Summer] I can’t see.
[Terry] Let your eyes adjust.
Don’t wanna go out like Watergate.
[Summer] Thanks.
[Terry] That ain’t me.
[faint clatter]
[Summer shudders]
[indistinct chatter]
[liquid splashing]
[indistinct chatter continues]
[man] A dummy check and we’re out.
[indistinct chatter continues]
[quiet, ominous music continues]
[Terry] Come on.
You smell that?
That ain’t history.
[Summer] Let’s leave.
[fire roaring]
Oh, shit!
[music intensifies]
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Shit!
[gasping]
Coconut water.
[Terry] All right, they’re expecting a blaze. We got 30 seconds tops.
Okay, pull those. I’ll get these.
[tense music playing]
[sighs] Damn it.
Okay, we exfil.
Weigh our options.
Hold on.
SD cards.
They write over ’em in the field so they never get wiped.
Straight from their dash cams.
It’s just last week’s but…
Mike’s in there?
All right.
[tense music continues]
[Summer] Wait.
What are you doing?
If we don’t restart it, they will.
[men chatter]
It’s a landmarked building.
That “history” down here, for a lot of people?
It’s got a pretty foul funk to it.
Yeah. Let it burn.
[indistinct chatter]
[man 1] Looking now.
[man 2] Just to be sure. Just in case. Go!
[explosive roaring]
We’re good! Move!
Sweep the courthouse, then we’re out.
[tense music continues]
You go. We go. We got ’em.
No. Start the car. I can’t…
I gotta get something back.
[alarm ringing]
That’ll send ’em running.
Go slow, go steady.
Meet me in the alley. Yeah?
Yeah.
Fuck!
[coughs]
[alarm continues ringing faintly]
[alarm continues ringing]
[dog barking]
[alarm continues ringing]
[car engine starts]
[tense music continues faintly]
[alarm continues ringing faintly]
Bingo!
You’re kiddin’.
How’s that for a dummy check?
[breathes deeply]
[faint clattering]
[tense music continues]
Turn that shit off!
[Summer moaning]
Come on. Come on.
[dog barking]
Fuck.
[car engine starts]
[distant dog barking]
[man shouting]
[loud thud]
[officer] Fuck! Fuck!
Shit!
Get the fuck off me!
[grunting]
[grunting and gasping]
You wanna be asleep when I cuff you or awake?
All right, okay!
[groans]
Fuck!
[grunts]
[tense music continues faintly]
Had to assume you’d shoot on sight.
Is she hurt?
Not that I could tell, no.
Where are they taking her?
I don’t know. Look, man. We’re not all, like…
I’m married. Okay? Okay. Hey, hey.
I got a kid. So…
Yeah?
So does she.
So let’s not waste any fucking time.
Get up.
[groans]
[panting]
Get me someone who knows.
[police radio beeps]
106, come in.
This is 103.
[Steve] 103, we’re 10-3. Keep it quiet.
106, is that in regards to the arson or the kidnapping? Over.
You got ten seconds before I start trying new frequencies.
Got some cards I wanna offload.
[cell phone ringing]
Left utility pocket.
[ringing continues]
[ringing stops]
[Steve] What brand are they?
Extreme Pro, 64 gigs.
[Steve] Okay, then. You know Rebel Ridge?
No.
[Steve] Drop you a pin. Settle up.
A swap?
You think I’m stupid?
[Steve] No. I think you’re smart.
Fuck it. First light.
[Steve] How about right now?
No, I got to see what’s waiting for me.
Works out well for you too.
[Steve] Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You just might see me comin’.
I put too much sauce on that?
Pop the trunk.
Fuck.
[music fades out]
[ship horn blowing]
[tense music continues]
What you got in that?
Number 4 buck, double-aught following.
Lose the number 4,
load up some slugs
‘case he grabs hold of someone.
Check in with Patrol.
He should be here.
Sun’s barely up.
If he isn’t early, he’s late.
[telephone ringing]
[tense music plays faintly]
[ringing continues]
Yeah?
Hello?
You know what’s funny, Chief?
[Sandy] You know, nothing comes to mind right off-hand.
Before two days ago, I’d never really been in a street fight.
I mean, a few scraps in a schoolyard,
but other than that, nothing outside the gym.
Well, I’ve been in plenty.
[Terry] Yeah, I can feel that from you.
That combative energy.
[Terry] It builds up. You know?
[Marston] 108. Got a visual on our suspect.
[Terry] It’s not just you. I know.
They’re on him.
[Terry] Both sides contribute.
Are you taking responsibility or dodging it?
108, can you confirm?
[music intensifies]
Stand by.
[Steve] Copy you, 108.
Standing by. 10…
Pack it up. He’s ready to move.
[Terry] People getting hurt now either way. The fire last night…
[Sandy exhales deeply]
Yeah, I heard about that.
Yeah, it’s gotten out of hand.
Real soup sandwich.
We can agree on that.
Got me thinking about that conversation we had in the cruiser,
about de-escalation.
That also takes both sides, you know?
So I was thinking,
what if we just walk away?
Well, now you’re starting to talk some…
But then I was like, “Nah.”
[call disconnects]
[music becomes intense and dramatic]
[Marston] Don’t you fucking move!
Goddamn it!
Negative! It’s McGill.
Got him all tied up.
He’s goin’ for the cash. Get on the radio!
[tense music continues]
[Jessica] All units, be advised…
[Jessica continues indistinctly]
[tense music swelling]
[screaming]
[Steve] Copy you.
Piece of shit!
[Jessica] Repeat, 10-19.
Suspect is at the station.
Request immediate assistance. Hurry.
[Steve] Find him and leave some for me!
[Jessica] We got walls coming down.
[indistinct shouting]
[dispatch] Copy. 10-76, en route.
Something wrong?
No, actually.
Think it’s all gonna line up pretty well.
Be advised, this is a silent run.
10-85. Nobody runs code.
All right, boss? Can you hold off? We gotta get to the station.
[tense music continues]
How’d I know you wouldn’t show up to your own show…
[gunfire exchanges]
[Sandy coughs and gasps]
[Terry] Hey! It’s okay.
Put that down!
Put your weapon down!
It’s okay!
Get on the ground! I’m gonna shoot!
It’s okay.
It’s a beanbag round.
[Sandy gasping]
Less lethal.
Listen, I know who you are.
[Sandy] Shoot him!
Summer didn’t give you up. It ain’t hard to narrow down.
We call you “Serpico.” Hey!
[Sandy] Shoot him!
Don’t worry about him. Worry about her.
Even if you don’t have my back, I know you got hers.
[Sandy gasping]
What you want me to do?
Hear me out.
[Sandy] Shoot that motherfucker…
Sit down!
[tense, dramatic music playing]
[dispatch over police radio] 102, we are at the scene. We got a…
Whatever’s on these, he’s willing to kill over.
[Sandy] You can go ahead.
Release ’em. See what happens.
[car tires screech]
Yeah. I’m with you on that.
Got this off your boys, though.
All right, here’s the new deal, Chief.
I’m seizing your shit.
When Summer McBride is safe, I hand myself in to the state police.
You get it back.
Otherwise…
It all burns.
[Jessica] Our guys just pulled up.
[Terry] Okay.
[quiet, tense music playing]
A lot of hardware out there.
[Jessica] I’ve seen what you can do.
So believe me. I’ll put two rounds in your head if you move an inch.
105 exiting station with suspect.
Hold your fire. Confirm.
[Steve over radio] 105, you have Terry Richmond? Over.
10-4. Confirm. Hold your fire.
[Steve] 10-4, holding fire.
[Jessica] Nobody dies today.
We’ll sort this out somewhere safe.
[quiet, tense music continues]
Hands on your head.
[officer] Piece of shit.
[Terry] Feel familiar?
[Jessica] Except for the weight of my gun.
Stop there.
Put down the bag.
Chief’s cuffed to the property cage.
Careful, he’s pissed.
He have drives on him?
He did. Says there’s some…
Stolen property.
Where they at?
Well done.
Got to get you out on patrol.
I feel dumb, man.
I mean,
your girl’s free to go.
It’s just, uh…
She’s pretty zonked out.
Thought I gave her a solid search,
but I missed that rig she had on her.
Must’ve hidden it somewhere sneaky.
Shot up in the backseat when I wasn’t looking.
I’d step back.
[fly buzzing]
[Terry] Hold on.
[Steve] Shh. Shh. Shh. Shhh.
Listen.
[snoring quietly]
Oh, man.
That snoring thing.
Shit creeps me out.
At least it’ll be peaceful.
All right. All right. All right. All right.
Step back from the bag.
[officer] That’s fucked.
[Steve] Hold on now, Ev.
We’re okay here.
Are we?
[Steve] Yes, table it.
Once he’s in custody and she’s on her way to the ER.
We wrap this up here. Let it play out.
[Marston] We’re sworn officers!
It’s a gift. We got her on a legit B&E, ties her directly to the fire.
Drives are gone. She goes away, this all goes away.
We’ll get commendations for putting a hole in this motherfucker’s chest!
Stand down.
Do not point your weapon at me!
[shouting]
She goes to the fucking hospital!
[Steve] You’re the shit magnet that started this!
[Marston] Stand down! Don’t do it!
Serpico.
I won’t watch her die!
Put that weapon down!
[gunfire]
[man shouting]
[groaning]
Sorry, Ev. Goddammit.
[Marston] Fuck.
[Sandy] It’s just the leg.
He’ll be back on light duty in a week, drawing full salary.
[McGill] Sir, he’s bleeding bad.
[groaning]
[officer] Looks like you nicked something there, Chief.
Shit.
[Jessica] Call Medical.
No! Now, hold on. Hold on.
Just hold on.
We all saw it.
It was either him or… or Steve.
[Steve] It was him or all of us.
[Sandy] Listen up now.
We can’t turn on each other,
because that’s the way this whole goddamn thing implodes, you hear me?
[men shouting]
[Steve] Hey, watch your back!
[Sandy] I got him.
[man 1] Go around there.
The suspect is armed! He goes down!
He does not get back up!
[man 2] Chief!
[men shouting]
[man 3] Light him up!
[men shouting]
[gunshots]
[Terry grunts]
[canister clatters]
Use those sting balls, the round ones.
[grunts] Fuck.
[Steve] Hold your fire!
[man] Watch his cross flare!
[explosion and gunfire]
[Steve] Go!
[McGill] Fuck!
[gunfire, explosions]
[shouting]
She’s in pretty bad shape. You guys carry Narcan?
[groaning] Above the center console. Most of us got kids.
Roger that. I’ll make a run.
Listen, you hit those disco lights, it’s gonna activate…
Dash cam.
Why? So I can record my own death?
No. Mine.
They got pre-event recording.
You hit the lights, the camera goes live,
records three minutes before you hit the switch.
Figure you got about two minutes left.
Shit, maybe you too.
Unless you put a finger right up in it.
[groans painfully]
Move to flank, he’s got…
[tense music continues]
[Marston groans]
[gunfire]
[man] Incoming!
[coughing]
Not sure who to shoot at.
[man] Move up! Hold your fire!
Then maybe don’t shoot.
[indistinct shouting]
[man] Barnett, go!
[Sandy] West, Tyler, get up here!
[man] Hold your fire!
[indistinct shouting]
[grunting]
[bones crunch]
[agonized grunt]
[man] He’s by the truck!
[Sandy] Which truck?
[indistinct shouting]
[gunfire]
[gunfire]
[Steve] Move the fuck away from him!
[indistinct shouting]
[Steve] Do not fire! Hold your fucking fire!
[man] Where is he?
[Steve] Do you see him?
Call it out!
Do not fucking fire…
[grunts]
Neckbone, motherfucker!
[grunting]
[coughing]
[gunfire]
[grunts]
[tense music becomes quiet]
[gunfire]
[man 1] No shot!
[indistinct chatter]
[man 2] Are those guys on the road block?
[man 3] Keep those boys out of this!
[man 4] Get some water.
[man 5] Can anybody fucking see him?
[indistinct chatter]
[indistinct chatter]
[panting]
[man 6] He’s moving!
[gunfire]
[gunfire continues]
[electronic bleeps]
[siren blaring]
[tense dramatic music playing]
Shit!
Go after that car!
Hang on, McBride!
[Jessica] Hey! That’s Evan Marston back there!
[gunfire]
[Terry] Keep that pressure up! I need you to walk me through this!
[Marston groaning]
[music becomes tense and quiet]
[explosion]
[indistinct shouting]
[Marston] Forget the instructions. Throw ’em out. Just open it up.
You don’t know how to… You don’t gotta prime it.
Just pick a nostril and deploy it. One push.
That’s it.
That’s it?
That’s it, man. Just give her a couple minutes.
Here we go! I’m picking you up!
[painful screaming]
[indistinct chatter]
[Jessica] I say we let him out. Take him on the road.
[Terry] McBride, hear me?
I need you to breathe!
[Steve] Fuck outta my…
[gun clicks]
[Marston] Go!
[horn honks]
[Marston] Go! Go! Go!
Oh, fuck!
Put some fire on that vehicle!
We got one of ours inside, another hangin’ off!
[Sandy] Got a stolen cruiser coming your way. Take that son of a bitch out.
[crash]
[dispatch over radio] Negative, do not take that shot.
We’ve got two officers onboard.
[groaning]
There’s glass everywhere.
[Steve panting]
[groaning]
[dispatch] He’s clear, take out the tires. Driver’s side only.
[gunfire]
McBride, you good?
[indistinct chatter]
[quiet, tense music continues]
[indistinct chatter]
On the road! Move! Move!
Hop in!
I’ll package up Ross for the paramedics. Be right behind you.
Call it in wide. We need to be on record before they are.
[tense, dramatic music playing]
[distortion]
[tense music becomes quiet]
The file. You got the chief shooting me on camera.
But the recording needs to survive.
If you’ve gotta bail, the DVR’s in the trunk.
He’s not gonna bail.
[dispatch] They are northbound on 13.
Oh, they’re on us.
[dispatch] This is 103 confirming we still have an officer on board that cruiser?
[Sandy] Negative. We got three armed suspects.
How’re we on speed?
[Sandy] Comin’ up on your left.
[man 1] Copy that, we’ll box ’em in.
Maxed out.
[Sandy] All right, who’s got the ARs?
[man 1] I got one. 103 has one onboard.
[Sandy] 105, 105, stand by for a PIT maneuver.
Are you up for it, Sims?
[Jessica] I got you, Chief.
[Sandy] 105, let me give you some room.
I can pull over.
[man 2] 105, we got your back.
We are standing by.
You guys make the call.
Fuck ’em. Don’t save ’em the trouble.
[Sandy] Execute!
[Jessica] Roger, Chief. 102, 104. Hang back.
[tense music continues]
[Sandy] Take ’em out.
[Sandy] 105, looks like you overshot!
We got a ticking clock here.
Give it another go, or I’ll do it my…
[man 1] Check in, 105. What’s your status?
[Jessica] Gonna need a wrecker. Otherwise, code four.
[man 1] You got the chief?
[Jessica] Affirmative. State Police are standing by.
[man 1] 102, we got a straight shot. We’re 10-59.
What’s a 10-59?
[quiet dramatic music playing]
That’s an escort.
[siren blaring]
[man 2] 10-4. Give Samaritan a heads-up on their inbound.
[panting]
[man 1] Affirmative, 102.
Officer onboard. State police are two minutes out.
[chuckles lightly]
[sobbing softly]
[dramatic music continues]
Medical’s on the way, Chief, but I need to see your hands.
[nurse] All right, we got two incoming.
[dramatic music continues]
[sirens blaring]
[indistinct chatter]
Bed!

Plot: At a Los Angeles hospital in the 1920s, Alexandria is a child recovering from a broken arm. She befriends Roy Walker, a movie stunt man with legs paralyzed after a fall. At her request, Roy tells her an elaborate story about six men of widely varied backgrounds who are on a quest to kill a corrupt provincial governor. Between chapters of the story, Roy inveigles Alexandria to scout the hospital’s pharmacy for morphine. As Roy’s fantastic tale nears its end, Death seems close at hand.

Nurse Evelyn ! Nurse Evelyn!
I have a message for you. In English!
(INAUDIBLE)
And here we go.
Now, look, here’s the list of all the patients we’ve had in the ward in the last month.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nurse.
(MACHINERY WHIRRING)
(BELL TOLLING)
(GASPS)
(MUTTERING)
ROY: You’re Alexandria?
Yes.
Your note came in, and landed on my lap.
Couldn’t even understand it.
It’s written in gibberish or something.
You didn’t understand it, didn’t you, didn’t understand it, it’s not for you.
(CHUCKLES)
My name’s Roy.
How’d you hurt your arm?




I fell.
Me too.
I was picking oranges.
Is that so?
How do you go to the potty?
I don’t. They let me go right here.
In bed?
Yeah, it’s true.
I don’t believe.
Hey, Alexandria.
Hey, do you know you’re named after Alexander the Great who was the greatest warrior who ever lived?
Yes. And my note is not in gibberish.
It’s in English!
(HOOF BEATS APPROACHING) Hey, I can see you. Come on out here.
MAN OUTSIDE: Whoa, whoa.
I can see you hiding.
Alexandria.
Hey, did you know he was also looking for a message?
He was lost.
He almost died, separated from his army.
ALEXANDRIA: Did he find the message?
What?
Did she find the message?
Alexandria the Great.
All right, right, I’ll tell you, just come in here.




Now, come on, grab that chair right there.
All right, don’t break your other arm.
Thank you. You’re welcome.
What’s in your box?
Things I like.
Things you stole?
No.
A photo.
Where’d you get the elephant?
My friend gave it to me at work.
He’s from India.
Look, this is my horse and this is my father.
Yeah?
He’s got the same gap in his teeth, must run in the family.
Yeah, and here is my house. Oh, yeah?
It was my house.
What happened?
They burn it.
Who burned it?
Angry people.
I’m sorry to hear that.
Hmm?
I said, I’m sorry to hear that.
Angry people.
Yeah, I know, I’m just sorry that your house got burned.




Why did Alexander didn’t go from that buildings on his horse?
If him was lost…
What?
Why did Alexander didn’t go from that middle of the buildings from that buildings on his horse?
Well…
First of all, he didn’t have a horse because his horse was killed in a battle.
And he wasn’t in the middle of any old buildings.
He was lost in the middle of a vast desert, full of orange sand with only a handful of men but they didn’t have any water.
Look!
“My Lord, all hope is lost.
“It seems your mighty army shall finally be conquered.
“Not by the Persians, but by our own greed and gluttony for water.
“This helmet contains our last supply.
“Oh, King, I believe your wisdom shall save us all.”
Why?
ALEXANDRIA: Why?
What?
Why?
Well, because there wasn’t enough water for all of them and it was Alexander the Great’s way of showing his army that they were all equal…
It’s stupid.
What would you do better?
Was Alexander throw the water instead to give every soldier a little bit.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOCTOR AND PATIENT CHATTERING)
Hey, why don’t you come back tomorrow and I’m going to tell you a different story.




An epic tale of love and revenge.
You know what “epic” means?
No.
I still got this tightness here. It’s like I can’t even…
It means a really long story, and it’s set in India.
PATIENT: …the elephant sitting on my chest.
DOCTOR: You should be fully recovered.
ROY: All right, go on.
I want you to examine me.
Will you come back tomorrow?
You personally. I’m not very well.
The swelling seems down.
DOCTOR: I know how much it hurts.
(LAUGHS)
DOCTOR: A sense of humor.
In the next couple of weeks the pain should abate, then one more operation.
Like the last one?
This is going to take some effort
on your part, too, you know that?
See?
(MOCK-GROWLING)
(CHILD COUGHING)
Come on, then.
NURSE EVELYN: Be back before lunch.
Okay.
Alexandria, get away from that ice.
I see you licking that ice, you’re gonna get sick.
I want you to go play, go!
Next time, I’ll glue your lips to this and carry you away.
ONE-LEGGED MAN: You’re lucky it was just a horse that got killed.
I mean, jumping off a train bridge was suicide, too.
And if you were trying to impress her…
Sinclair already did a better job.
You know, the actor,
the leading man.
I know who he is.
Every cloud has a silver lining, that’s for sure.
PRIEST: Take another card.
ONE-LEGGED MAN: You know, before my accident…
That is the Queen of Hearts.
…nothing was happening for me.
Now I’ve had my leg hacked off by savages,
mangled by chariots, sawed off by lumberjacks.
Hell, I’ve even had a harpoon through it.
I’m working all the time.
(MAKING YIPPING NOISES)
PRIEST: That is the two of spades.
ONE-LEGGED MAN: The studio is just trying to do right by you.
PRIEST: Excuse me, Mr. Sabatini.
ONE-LEGGED MAN: Take the money.




Anyway, gags are not for you, Roy.
You’re a college man.
Wasn’t me.
ONE-LEGGED MAN: One cripple to another…
I didn’t throw orange at you.
…no woman is worth suicide.
Like the guy’s a movie star, for Christ sake.
(WHISPERING) Was your friend a pirate?
Was your friend a pirate?
Sometimes.
Is that how he hurt his leg?
No, he… He does tricks for pictures.
You know, flickers.
Moving pictures.
I never seen one.
You’re not missing much.
Is that what you do, like your friend?
Just once.
Will you tell me the story now?
What story?
The epic.
All right.
All right, close your eyes.
What do you see?
Nothing.
Rub them.
Can you see the stars?
Yes.
It was a starry night.
Four men waited impatiently on a small island
surrounded by a calm sea.
But that calmness was deceptive.
For at that moment
an Indian with a bandaged thigh swam towards them.
Tell me, Indian.
Is it true?
Luigi, is what true?
Governor Odious will execute your twin brother tomorrow morning.
My poor brother.
ROY: In all, there were five of them.
They had only one thing in common,
a hatred of Governor Odious.
The first was an ex-slave, Otta Benga.
He and his brother were born into slavery
only to fill the coffers of the evil Governor Odious.
One day while toiling in the fields…
(SOBS)
Heartbroken at his brother’s death, he freed the slaves
and swore that he would be responsible for Governor Odious’s death.
(SCREAMING)




ALEXANDRIA: I like him.
ROY: Then, there was the Indian,
who, whenever anxious, always stroked his brow.
The Indian was supposedly married
to the most beautiful squaw in the world
yet nobody had seen her.
To verify this, Odious disguised himself as a leper
but when he saw her reflection, he was smitten.
Locking the doors to his wigwam, the Indian stood guard.
Little did he know, he was guarding an empty home
for his wife had already been kidnapped by the evil Governor Odious.
But the squaw refused to show herself to him.
So, Odious had her thrown into the Labyrinth of Despair.
Eventually she realized there was only one way out.
While mourning his wife’s death
the Indian took a blood oath never to look at another squaw
and that he would be responsible for Governor Odious’s death.
(SCREAMING)
ALEXANDRIA: I like him, too.
Luigi was an explosive expert.
When Odious heard about the power of his new bombs,
he had him publicly banished.
On his return, Luigi discovered that everybody hid from him
because even speaking to him was punishable by death.
But when his own priest refused to hear his confession,
Luigi swore…
(ROARING)
…that he would be responsible for Governor Odious’s death!
Next was the English naturalist
Charles Darwin.
He loved all living things,
creatures, plants, everything alive.
Darwin was always accompanied by his shy, brilliant colleague,
(CHATTERING) Wallace the monkey.
What is that, Wallace?
(SQUEAKING)
I don’t know why flamingos are pink.
Even though they had developed many theories together
they were still looking for something.
(ALEXANDRIA SPEAKS ROMANIAN)
What?
Butterfly.
That’s a good guess.
In fact, a very specific butterfly
called Americana Exotica.
One day, Odious sent them a dead one.
(SCREAMING)
Butterfly Reef.
This Odious, it’s bad man?
Oh, yeah.
Butterfly Reef.
That’s where Governor Odious chose to banish our heroes,
to mock them,
hoping that in their fight for survival they would devour each other.
So, the buccaneers were trapped on this island.
What means a buccaneer?
Well, it’s like a pirate. Pirate and buccaneer, it’s like the same thing.
But I don’t like pirate stories.
You’re the one who asked for a pirate story.
Mmm-mmm.
No.
Yes, you did.
Mmm-mmm.
I just wanted to know if your friend was a pirate.
Why? Because he has just one leg.
Oh, right.
Well, yeah, it’s not a pirate story.
It’s a story about bandits.
(DOUBTFULLY) Mmm.
In fact, our masked hero couldn’t even swim.
I need to learn to swim.
Finally, very little was known about the gap-toothed Masked Bandit.
(GROWLING MENACINGLY) Like my father?
Yes, your father.
Except that he and his twin brother, the Blue Bandit,
had escaped execution from the Spanish Governor Odious.
Knowing that their chances of survival were better apart
the two brothers separated
swearing that they would kill Governor Odious.
(SCREAMING)
We must conceive a plan!
I need to get off this island, and rescue my twin brother.
(SCOFFS)
(SQUEAKING)
(WALLACE CHATTERING) What? What?
All elephants?
I say, we…
I have an idea.
(ELEPHANT TRUMPETS)
Darwin ! That was a great idea!
Come on, Otta Benga!
(ELEPHANT TRUMPETS)
Goodbye, my beautiful friend!
(TRUMPETING) Have a nice swim!
Darwin, you are a genius!
Much obliged!
Where do you get these ideas?
(WOOD CRACKING)
What is it, my friend?
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
How sad. The tortures of this world have driven the poor man mad.
Not true.
He said he has been sent by his mystic cult
to help us against Governor Odious and his Spanish henchmen.
(CONTINUES MURMURING)
DARWIN: This region was once a lush forest
alive with birds and sacred trees
but Odious had them all burned down.
He also says the birds are safe inside his belly
but we must take care, for only the fittest shall survive.
Tell him we have no use of a mystic.
We are on a dangerous mission.
We need to hurry to the fort to save my twin brother.
He will only slow us down.
(WHISTLES)
Fish, señor!

(WHISTLES)
(ALL SNARLING)
Stand aside, my friend.
Before you say kaboom, I have this door open.
Forgive me, wise mystic, for my disrespect.
Undoubtedly, you have a flair for war-mongering.
It would be my honor if you consider joining us
on our quest.
We must save your brother!
First,
a little test.
You can’t stop there.
I just wanna play a little game.
I want you to go outside and touch one of my toes.
No, tell me the story.
What happened with the Blue Bandit?
It won’t take long. Just go outside and touch one of my toes.
Okay.
I’m touching your little toe. No!
Please don’t tell me which toe you’re touching. I gotta guess.
That’s the whole point of the game.
All right. Uh-huh.
I’m touching one.
I’m touching one.
You’re touching my big toe?
Mmm-hmm.
Are you telling the truth?
Mmm-hmm.
Look.
Really.
Oh, I got that?
What happened?
What happened with his brother? Did he save him?
No, no, no, no. Were you telling a story?
Uh-huh.
No, no, no. Were you telling the truth just now?
No. I was telling the truth.
No. You just said no, you weren’t telling the truth.
No, I tell you it.
Were you telling the truth?
Yeah.
When you just touched my toe?
Uh-huh.
You little liar.
No.
Alexandria, were you lying to me?
I touch your big toe.
LUIGI: We need to hurry!
Do you want me to finish the story?
The Masked Bandit arrived at the Chandelier Hall too late.
Odious had already tortured his brother and crew
and hung them.
All right, that’s it! It’s not a circus.
It’s not a playground for all your…
Please! Are you listening to me?
Get out of here!
You leave her alone.
Come here, baby.
Get off! Goddamn!
No, no, no, sweetheart, come here, come here. Come on.

Will you stop that? Leave him alone!
What’s that?

Where’d you get it?
The chapel.
I’m sorry I shouted at you.
I was angry.
No problem.
Are you trying to save my soul? Mmm?
Are you trying to save my soul?
Do you understand me? What?
Did you understand what I meant?
What you said?
I said, are you trying to save my soul?
Giving me that.
What mean that?
The Eucharist. It’s a…
What?
The Eucharist. The thing you gave me. It’s a…
It saves your soul.
The thing I gave to you, what?
The little piece of bread that you just gave me.
It saves your soul.
What? What? What? Are you worried about me?
Saves your soul.
Do you know what “soul” means?
ALEXANDRIA: No.
It’s like strength.
ALEXANDRIA: Hmm.
(WHISPERING) Why does the old man keep his teeth in a glass at night?
It’s where he keeps his strength, his spirit.
His spirit is in those teeth.
Yeah.
Oh, you’re missing a little strength
right in the front of your mouth.
The chapel’s in the main block, isn’t it?
Yes. What happened with the Black Bandit?
I’m sorry.
It’s okay.
They keep the medicine in the main block, don’t they?
Yes.
That which has been taken from me can never be replaced.
My brother…
ALEXANDRIA: Why he speaks like this?
Because he’s your father.
But my father is dead.
What?
Okay, how do you want me… How do you want him to speak?
BANDIT: I think of all the joys we had.
ALEXANDRIA: Normal, like you.
(SPEAKING NORMALLY) I could’ve saved you, but I was weak.
My grief has gone blood-red with revenge.
I’m stronger now.
I will search the four corners of this Earth,
find Governor Odious and joyously kill him!
By the Blue Bandit’s honor, I swear
I will annihilate him and everything that he loves!
I will destroy him!
(ECHOING) I will destroy him!
(ECHOING) Destroy him ! I will destroy him!
And every Spanish thing.
ALEXANDRIA: I thought he was Spanish.
No.
He was French.
Are you with me, bandits?
(ALL RESPONDING IN FRENCH)
BANDIT: Darwin ! Which way to Governor Odious?
I tell him not to put the map with the bugs.
BANDIT: Are we lost?
Sorry, Capitaine.
Hey! No!
Hey! You can’t eat it, it’s poisonous!
(GRUNTING HUNGRILY)
(MUMBLING)
BANDIT: What’s he saying?
He says we should follow him to greener pastures!
What?
He say it’s greener down there.
BANDIT: Green? Down where?
I don’t know.
DARWIN: To greener pastures! Slow down!
(GRUMBLING)
The birds in his belly crave greener pastures!
LUIGI: Hey! It is greener down there.
Greener pastures.
Slow down!

Please don’t run!

You always stop at the same part when it’s very beautiful

I just wanted to know if you can read English.
Can you?
Can you read English?
Yeah.
What’s this?
Paper.
No. What’s this? This.
M-o-r-p-h…
Three.
What’s that? Three.
That’s good.

I’m having a hard time sleeping
and I can’t remember that story.
I need some pills.
I need pills in a bottle that has this written on them.
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three?
Yes. And it’s in the main block.
In that room in the main block.
You understand?
Ask the head nurse.
I’m asking you as a friend.
But it’s stealing. No, it’s not.
Not if you need it.
It’s no different than stealing bread from a church.
I’ll ask them for you.
No.
It’s a bandit secret.
I need the pills to finish the story. Understand?
I can’t get it… I’ll do it.
Thanks.
You look beautiful.
Why do you put red on your cheeks?
Because it makes you look pretty
and healthy, too.

There are snake pits all over this area.

Googly, googly, googly. Go away.
Did you get what I sent you for?
Yes.
This it is.
Yeah?
There’s only three in here.
You asked me for three.
No, I asked you for a full bottle.
But, you wrote…
Was this bottle full of pills?
Were there more pills in here? Yeah.
What did you do with them?
I throw them in toilet.
But I throw them away because you wrote

ALEXANDRIA: Why the mask again?
He doesn’t want to scare her.
She doesn’t know anything about him,
but he knew everything about her.
The color of her eyes.
Brown.
Her favorite food.
Orange?
Her favorite book.
Bible.
(CHUCKLES)
Boys, she’s mine.
What about the bomb? What?
The bomb.
The bandits kidnapped the princess,
leaving behind her little nephew.
They rode down from the high mountain deserts to a place he loved.
He had played as a child with his twin.
A palace in the middle of a lake.
(SQUEAKING)
What’s the matter with that poor fellow?
Ever since the Indian’s misfortune
he took a vow to never look at another squaw.
But a man cannot show what’s in his heart when he hides his face.
Who, may I ask, are you?
To most I am known as the Masked Bandit.
(GASPS)
The Scourge of the Southeast?
That’s the one.
But that’s only when I wear the mask.
Who are you?
Nurse Evelyn.
Once I was Lady Evelyn Everest Everhardt,
and now I am simply called…
Sister Evelyn.
She is not a sister.
Bless you. No. What? Yes, she is.
She doesn’t have brothers and sisters.
No, she’s a nun, like these nuns out here.
And she turned from the Masked Bandit, and she said…
May I be frank with you?
Of course.
Although I’ve dedicated my life to God and goodness
I secretly love throwing oranges at our priest.
Take two turns to the left and go to the bathroom.
No, you read my note.
What are you talking about?
Go to the bathroom.
No.
How do you know about the priest and the orange?
Everybody knows you like throwing oranges at the priest.
Even the priest knows,
but I didn’t find that out from your gibberish message.
It’s not gibberish.
(WOMAN SPEAKING ROMANIAN)
WOMAN: Doctor?

She wants to ask you how much days I have to stay here.
Well, I want you to stay here until you get better.
Her cast will come off in a few days
but I’d like her to stay here until she’s completely recovered.
(SPEAKING ROMANIAN)
She wants to say that we are spend here too much times
and we have to leave the city.
No, well, you just tell her that you shouldn’t be working in the groves.
That at your age it’s dangerous
and you’ll spend the rest of your days picking fruit.
And then she’ll fall. She surely will fall.

Hey, kid!
I made this for you.
Who’s in the mask?
You

It’s beautiful.
I’ll keep it forever.
I hope I never get better.
Why?
Because I want to stay here with you.
Hey, this came for you today.
Really?
You like chocolate?
I like it.
Do you want me to finish the story?
Yes.
I need a favor.
What kind of favor?
You know our friend Walt?
He’s not my friend.
He’s not my friend either.
I retrieved this key from him
because I think he’s been stealing my pills.
I think he’s got them in his cabinet there.
I want you to go check and see if he’s got them.
Why? I got you the bottle.
There weren’t enough in there for me to go to sleep.
Come on. Be a good bandit.
I don’t want to be a bandit.
That’s too bad.
Because Odious’s castle is surrounded by a big blue city.
(CROWS CROWING)
And that’s where the bandits are headed for their final encounter.
It’s the best part of the story, and since you’re leaving soon
I’d hate for you to spend your whole life wondering how it turned out.
What’s in the drawer?
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Stuff Walt’s been stealing from me.
(WHISPERING) What?
I won’t know until you go look.
Promise you’ll finish the story?
Yeah.
It’s that brown bottle.
This one?
That’s the one.
I think he stole it from me.
That’s mine.
Where did we leave off?
They were telling secrets each other.
BANDIT: I’m looking for the man who murdered my father.
ROY: The Black Bandit said…
My brother, the Blue Masked Bandit…
ROY: He said…
BANDIT: …tried to avenge our father’s death.
ROY: I’ve been on a quest for revenge.
Tortured and hung.
ROY: He told her everything about his life
except for the name of Governor Odious.
You need to leave.
ROY: You should go.
ALEXANDRIA: But you promised you’ll tell me the story.
You’ve captivated my heart, Evelyn.
That’s why I can no longer keep you in captivity.
I’ve fallen in love with you.
But I am consumed with revenge.
I’m not a man who can be loved.
When I fall asleep, you gotta go.
And don’t come back tomorrow.
Okay.
Thank you.
I’m sorry about this.
Why?
I’m sorry.
Why?
I don’t want you to see me like this.
You think you took me captive?
In fact, you’re my savior.
I was like a bird in a golden cage.
By freeing me, you captured my heart.
ALEXANDRIA: Make them kiss.
No, I don’t want to make them kiss.
(GROANS IN DISAPPOINTMENT)
Why?
Because what they’re about to find out.
She should have not come with us.
Why?
It is too dangerous.
If we are captured, Governor Odious shall surely kill her.
You mentioned Odious?
He is my sworn enemy.
And my fiancė.

you know, smiling away, playing with his teeth.
I just don’t feel very well, Doc.
I don’t know what the hell’s wrong with me. Cough.
What, am I going delirious from the medication?
I don’t know what the hell…
(SOBBING)
Roy!
Roy, I thought you were dead.
Saw two men, and they were carrying the body away.
And then I tried to pinch your toe.
I run after you,
and after that one of the doctors told me, “Shoo!”
And I had to go away.
I’m sorry. I promise, but you…
(STIFLING SOBS)
I bring you more medicine if you want. Sugar.
I promise… They’re giving him sugar.
Come here!
Oh, well, that’s great, you’re awake.
I brought your x-rays…
Doc… Hey, you wanna take a look…
…the old man’s dead and you’re…
Hey. Roy! That’s it!
(SCREAMING)
Will you shut up, already?
You shut up!
Get out of here! You’re not really sick, Walt!
They’re feeding you sugar!
DOCTOR: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I’ve had enough of you!
Nurse!
What do you mean, they’re giving me sugar?
Here you go, Doctor.
She’s wet herself.
Get her out of here.
(ROY SCREAMING)
Go back to your room. Orderlies!
(ROY CONTINUES SCREAMING)
You should be in bed, Alexandria.
There’s more fires in the field.
It’s kerosene.
The kerosene stops the fruit from freezing.
No, it’s Mystic.
He’s coming out of that tree to help Roy.
I think it’s bedtime, young lady.
No more time for funny talk.
Into bed now.
And maybe one day
you can take me downstairs and introduce me to your friend Roy.
We go downstairs and say good night?
No. He’s not allowed any visitors.
Your friend, Roy, needs to rest.
He’s very sad. He’s lost his girlfriend.
He needs to sleep.
But he can’t. He needs medicine to sleep, but he doesn’t have any.
That’s the problem.
I’m sure they’re taking very good care of him.
Now, it’s time for bed.
Little girls need to go to sleep, too.
I’m not little. I am five.
Of course.
I forgot.

To get better, you gotta have the will…

…and your own desire to live.
I fell again.
I heard. Everybody’s heard.
You’re famous.
Are they angry?
Yeah,
but not at you.
I try to take more pills, but I fell.
It was the wrong thing, and…
What? I put my foot on it when I went up
and later on the thing made me go like that and I fell.
(CLOCK CHIMES)
I didn’t tell anybody about our secret.
Even when they tortured me with needles.
Is that a pirate’s flag?
Uh-huh… Uh-uh.
Is that yes or no?
Tell me the story.
I should go. You need your rest.
But I want to talk.
I know you do.
You promised.
The story was just a trick to get you to do something for me.
What?
I was…
But I need the story.
You should ask someone else.
There’s no happy ending with me.
I still want to know.
(MOANS)
Ask your friend, Nurse Evelyn,
she’ll tell it better than I will.
I don’t want her in the story!
She’s okay.
Uh-uh.
Oh, she doesn’t really love Governor Odious.
She’s just pretending.
I saw her with one of the hospital men.
She was just pretending to love you.
Just like your girlfriend.
I see.
Governor Odious with Nurse Evelyn!
She’s right.
She’s right!
We don’t need her.
She can’t be trusted.
You give them your heart, but all they really want is your wallet.
Sooner or later she’s gonna leave him for a richer man.
Is a trap.
ROY: I understand.
I don’t like it.
ROY: Thank you for telling me.
Is a suicide. For all of us.
We’re going.
(WHISPERING) Hey, Indian, what means suicide?
(CHATTERING) Wallace?
Wallace!
Wallace!
Wallace, what are you doing?
Wallace, please will you come down?
Please, this really isn’t the time.
Wallace, please!
Wallace, will you come down?

Wallace, what did you do?

ALEXANDRIA: Does he really died?
Let’s go!
I’m all washed-up!
Uncle Darwin, there’s angry people. Don’t leave me, my friend.
I’ll tell everyone they were your idea.
They’re going to find out I’m a fraud!
Go on ! Shoot, you animals!
They’ll pay you well for Darwin’s hide.
ROY: He died, too.
ALEXANDRIA: And Wallace, too?
Did he really died?
Yeah, and in Wallace’s case, happily so.
It was the natural order of things.
ROY: All things must die.
Damn it all!
(ALL SNARLING)
Back! Get back!
Kaboom.
(SNICKERING)
ODIOUS: If you want something done…
Get down there!
…you have to do it yourself.
Get down there, you animals!
And bring them up here!
ALEXANDRIA: I don’t like this! I don’t like this story.
Why are we running away?
(GASPING IN TERROR)
ALEXANDRIA: Why did Luigi kill himself?
Why did not he come with us?
ROY: And live as half a man?
He couldn’t do that.
He gave up.
It’s not very satisfying, is it?
He didn’t think so either.
(MYSTIC GROANING)
ALEXANDRIA: (CRYING) Please, the Mystic.
Why? Why are they killing the Mystic?
We need to go help him.

We are here.

PRINCESS: Roy!
ALEXANDRIA: (CRYING) Don’t look at her.
She is also with Odious.
ROY: Quiet.
Just like your girlfriend.
Shut up.
PRINCESS: No!
Your girlfriend came with Odious to see you…
The bandit entered Odious’s garden…
But she stood in the car and she…
But Odious was nowhere to be seen.
And Odious…
As the bandit ran past Odious’ hiding place,
Odious cracked him in the nose!
No, but wait a little. Wait, please!
(ALEXANDRIA SOBBING)
So he sank to the bottom of the pool.
He didn’t even try to swim.
You are making this up.
No, I’m not.
And he started to sink and he was dying.
(SCREAMING)
Let him live.
Get up!
Roy, get up and fight!
ODIOUS: Get up!
Oh, what a shame! Look, God damn it!
Get up!
Look at him ! Look at him!
Get up!
I want you to see how pathetic he really is.
I can’t get up!
Get up! I can’t get up!
For God’s sake, the water’s only waist high. Get up, Daddy!
I’m not your father.
How pathetic! Look at him!
He’s a drug addict!
Your father is a coward.
A useless good-for-nothing!
Dad, get up!
He can’t win!
That’s because our Masked Bandit’s a coward!
Yeah, he never took an oath.
A fake, he’s a liar and a coward.
You’re lying!
No. He had his fingers crossed.
He has to die.
ALEXANDRIA: I don’t believe you.
ROY: He was dying.
Don’t kill him.
I’ll bring you more pills if you want.
Dad, get up!
Don’t kill him.
There’s nothing left for him.
His daughter.
He wasn’t her father, either.
She loves him.
She’ll survive. She’s young.
I don’t want you to die.
Don’t kill him.
Let him live.
Let him live.
Don’t kill him.
(STIFLES SOB)
(MOANS)
Promise? And don’t cross your fingers.
I promise.
Show me your hands.
See?
(ROARING)
(YELLING)
ALEXANDRIA: No more fighting.
He needs to go to his daughter. It’s okay.
It’s okay. It’s all right. It’s over now.
(GRUNTS)
Give me a kiss.
(MOANING)
Roy,
you do realize it was all a test
to see if you truly loved me, don’t you?
(GROANING)
We’re finally free to follow our hearts.
By all means.
Follow your heart.
Hmm!
I’m not feeling very well.
We’re a strange pair, aren’t we?
Mmm-hmm.

SINCLAIR: Did I just miss something?
That was it?
That was his big stunt?
He didn’t even use that horse thing.
ALEXANDRIA: I put old man’s teeth there because I think that
the Mystic comes out of the tree
and it will grow a special orange tree.
INDIAN: Alexandria! Alexandria!
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
And we’ll have oranges inside with teeths, with teeth inside.
(SPEAKING ROMANIAN)
ALEXANDRIA: When I get out from the hospital, I miss Roy very much.
My mother told me that he plays in pictures and he does things that the other actors cannot do like falling and hitting and when they climb on something, when they…
I didn’t believe my mother, but then I saw him.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
(LAUGHING) I watch the picture again and again and again and to make sure that was Roy, and was Roy!
And then, I like the action from all the pictures because I know that Roy is making all the falling and hitting and climbing and he was on the stairs and he was going up and down and up and down.
And he was falling from the train and he was taking the car…
And he was falling from the bicycle and from a big house.
It was Wallace!
He was falling with the rope and he was hit and he was going, “Mwah! Mwah!”
“Thank you, thank you, thank you very much!”"

that one of Petrov’s own security team
did the hit. You’re clean.
Am I?
Are you asking professionally or philosophically?
I don’t know.

The murder and shooting?

That wasn’t in the program notes.
How did you end up here?
I don’t run into many Americans.

I travel all over Europe
and this was central, affordable, low-key.
You got family?
Uh…
I joined the army when I was 18.
I’m not sure anybody noticed when I left.
I didn’t think to remind them.
What do you do now?
Retirement planning.
(CHUCKLES) What?
Could you help a dancer who needs to retire soon?
You’re too young to retire.
Dancers are like boxers.
Father Time remains undefeated.
Don’t you love dancing?
The last 10 years, two ankle surgeries
torn ligaments, stress fractures.
I’m not complaining.
I love dance. I really do.
My mom had to work two jobs to afford my ballet classes
so to me, it could never be just a hobby.
So I was thinking when I retire
I could start a dance school for kids like me.
A place where they get to decide
who they really want to be.
(LAUGHS)
It all sounds a bit too crazy, but…
I don’t think so.
No. I think it sounds perfect.
Well, if that doesn’t work out,

FLOOD: Uh-oh.
I’ll show you later.
FLOOD: Okay.
MAIZE: Maybe. If you want. ZVI: Joseph…
We are surrounded.
I surrender.
I surrender with you.
Yes?
We give up.
We surrender.
(LIVELY CHATTER, LAUGHTER)
ZVI: I can see why you’re retiring.
Boychik, if you’re getting serious with Maize
tell her what you do. All of it.
I told Sharon everything very early on.
If Maize loves you, she’ll understand.
You played by the rules. Women respect integrity.
If she finds out later,
the trust you built,
it’s gone.

DR. KAGEN: We got the results from those tests.
I’m afraid (SIGHS) I’ve got some bad news, Joe.
You have Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
It’s a neurodegenerative disorder.
Which means what exactly?
It means rapid motor-neuron disintegration
leading to a loss of coordination.
Severe headaches, blindness,
and diminished mental capacity.
Are you positive?
Yeah.
I had the sample tested by three separate labs
and I got the same result. (SHARP INHALE)
Now, I’m going to order some more tests.
(SIGHS)
Okay.
So what am I looking at?
Chemo? Something like that?
DR. KAGEN: Hm.
There is no cure.
The first step should be to get you into palliative care
and the sooner we begin treatment,
the more comfortable we can make this for you,
okay?
(SIGHS)
(EXHALES, CLEARS THROAT)
How long do I have?
Best case, three months.
Things will deteriorate quickly,
but there are things we can do to make it easier.
Turn me into a vegetable while I wait to die.
I don’t think so. No.

Sorry, what’s the matter with you?
Who’s getting retired?
Me.
I’m the target.
I’ll pay. Don’t worry.
The going rate, two million.
Can you explain to me exactly what is going on?
I got a disease. You know, the headaches.
I’m… I’m getting the shakes and…
and it’s gonna take me out.
Here’s a little over a half a million
in mixed currency and gold coins.
I want you to liquidate everything else.
It all goes to Maize through the life insurance.
No, Joseph. This is madness.
The life insurance won’t pay out for a suicide.
She has to believe it.
So I’ll pay you to assign an assassin.
You choose who.
No.
This is what we do. We go to every doctor.
If they say it’s hopeless, we go up the mountain,

I don’t want Maize to see me like that.
You know what I think?
I think you want to protect her from the truth
of who you really are.
Zvi, I’m asking you for your help.
I’d do the same for you.
That’s some comfort. Thanks.
It’s what I’ve decided.
I’ll see your wishes are carried out

I’ve thought about doing this for years.
Might have risked it if it wasn’t
professional suicide.

Fucking hell. You good, yeah?
All right.
(UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
MAX: You were right.
His old handler is trying to set up an out.
ANTOINETTE: Where?
Some old castle on the mountain road
between here and Prague.
For sure?
He tried to hide it all, but his tech isn’t quite
as good as ours.
(SCOFFS)
Zvi stopped with tech around the time
the digital clock was invented.
Maximilious,
notify the hitters and call up your mercenaries.
Joe Flood might think he can hold off a few assassins
but he can’t fight an army too.

ANGUS: Here we go.
Location update.
Schatzberger Castle.
It’s a fucking stupid name, isn’t it?
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
How’s the drive?
Scenic.
Your plan worked.
Antoinette posted the change of location.
It’s a free-for-all.
Four million for all.
Nobody in my stable will touch it,
even for four million.
You must be loved.
Your old friend Lovedahl took the bait.
FLOOD: Four million buys a lot of vinyl.
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS)
(ENGINE REVVING)
Sweetheart, what do you really know about Flood?
That he’s kind and gentle.
Gentle? Your lover-man has been,
for the last 20 years,
the most prolific professional hitman in Europe.
You need a job done right, give it to Joe.
Joe Flood, more hits than Motown.
Then you better hope he doesn’t find you.
Baby girl…
I got four million reasons why I need him to.

If you hurt her…
I don’t want to.
All I want to do is collect, but you have my word.
You get through all that, present your big ass to me,
and I will let your little ballerina here go.
You feel me?
Me for her?
That’s the real real.
Can I get a little help?
Come on, brother. That would be unethical.
And kidnapping my woman?
I’m morally flexible.

You should’ve told her the truth, Flood.

That might be the first intelligent thing

So, now what?
The contract is still active.
Oh, I’m not splitting my money

We’re mercenaries. We already got paid.

What? No. Joe.
No, I don’t think you did.
But I don’t think it felt great.

The night we met, the men who died…
Yeah, that was me.
That was opening night!
I’m sorry.
And how about the last 24 hours, Joe?
Do you have an explanation for that?
Or some bullshit apologies?
No.
I thought I was dying.
What?
I hired an old enemy to take me out clean.
It turns out I was misdiagnosed.
(EXCLAIMS) What?
I tried to protect you.
Protect me from who?
A bunch of killers or you?
Both! From all of it.
What do you do for a living?
Huh?
(SIGHS)
Maize, I’m a hitman.
You kill people?
Well, I’m retired from that.
(SCOFFS) You look it.
I’m retiring.
You’re a murderer for hire!
(SIGHS) That’s what an assassin is, yeah.
I don’t know if it’ll make any difference
but the people I work for,
we don’t kill civilians, just criminals.
Well, that’s what you’ve been doing.
You’re retired.
Yes.
Good, because I’m not having a kid with a killer.
A kid?
I’m pregnant, Joe.
I tried to tell you the other night
but you broke up with me.
Look, I love you, you love me,
and the rest we’ll figure out as we go, okay?
I swear, I’ll never lie to you again.
Are you okay?
You better fucking not…
Hey. Maize?
Jeez.

(GLASS CLINKING)
Perhaps I can be of some assistance?
Not unless you’re a doctor.
Do I look like a doctor?
Is there one in the village?
There’s a half decent vet. The nearest doctor

Hey, baby. Are you okay?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Joe.
Baby.
(GROANS)
Easy.
You got shot.
(GROANING)
It hurts.
It just grazed you.
I thought I was gonna lose you.
You’re gonna have to try harder than that.
Maize, I love you.
Will you marry me?
What?
Marry me.
Be my wife.
To have and to hold,
sickness and health, the whole thing.
Yeah?
Yeah. (LAUGHS)
Yeah?
Yeah.
Father, will you marry us?
Do you have a marriage license?
No.
Do you have any witnesses?
You.
Are you even Catholic?
I think my mother was.
Oh. So it’s guilt by association.
Look, Father, in the last day
I’ve had more people try to kill me than I can count,
and I just found out I’m gonna be a father.
So I might not get another shot at this,
so what do you say?
On one condition.
FLOOD: Yeah, name it.
You must give confession.
Ooh.
I don’t think we have that kind of time, Father.
Make time.
Oh, man.
So that brings us up to the last couple months.
(SIGHS) Um…
There was a chief of a Corsican crime syndicate.
That was one shot over a mile out.
A Romanian arms dealer.
Uh, did him at close range with a pistol.
A rogue British agent in Geneva.
That was hand-to-hand…
A Russian oligarch in Vienna, a garrote.
I mean, real quiet.
In all my years as a priest, as a human being,
I have never heard anything remotely…
And last night, there was the entire Goyang crew.
They came after me, so technically, self-defense.
Murder is murder is murder.
No technicalities.
Most of my targets never saw it coming.
Kind of a point of pride with top hitmen.
Pride is a sin.
Well, kind of lightweight
compared to contract killing, right?
I’m not sure I’m qualified to pardon all of this.
What, do you need to call the Vatican or something?
They’d tell me to call the police.
(SIGHS)
Look, Father.
The way I see it is your boss, the man upstairs,
he’s given me a second chance.
I’m gonna be a father,
so I don’t want to mess that up.
I’ll give you redemption,
but no more killing, no more murder.
Well, there might be some self-defense in the near future.
Do you get this? It’s a sin. It’s wrong.
You asked for a confession.
I wish I kept my mouth shut if we’re both being honest here.
So are you gonna marry us now, or what?
(SIGHS)
Ego te absolvo. I absolve you.
All right. Thank you, Father.
FATHER: Dearly beloved, you’re gathered here today
in the presence of God
to declare your love, honor, fidelity,
and commitment to one another
for as long as you both shall live.
I don’t suppose you have a ring, do you?
Um… Oh!
Will this do?
As long as the grenade is far away.
It went off hours ago. One of the party girls.
I lost track. Silly me.
Back to the wedding.
(MAIZE LAUGHS)
Do you, Joe, take this woman
to love, honor and obey
in sickness and in health for as long as you shall live?
I do.
(CHUCKLES)
And do you, Maize, take this man
to love, honor, and obey?
I don’t know about obey.
Maize!
(GUNSHOTS)
(GROANS)
I object!
You couldn’t have waited 30 seconds?
You done made this shit hard enough!

I don’t think so!

Okay.
You’re okay. You’re okay.
All right. Keep pressure on that.

It’s not personal.

but don’t leave a brother hanging.
Come on, Flood! Get me out of here!
Really?
Come on, man!
FLOOD: Maybe you should retire too.
Y’all don’t leave me here!

ZVI: You know better than to run.
Your boy hasn’t left me any choice.
There’s only two ways out of the game, Antoinette.
Who put the contract on me?
You did.
You hired mercenaries on a contract job.

Season 2 – Episode 1

Episode title: Heavy Is the Crown

Original air date: November 9, 2024
Plot: Jayce, Mel, and Councilors Shoola and Salo survive Jinx’s rocket attack on the Council, but Councilors Haskel, Bolbok, and Cassandra—Caitlyn’s mother—are killed. Viktor is mortally wounded; Jayce reneges on his promise to destroy the Hexcore and instead uses it to save him. The Council plans retaliation against Zaun, though Mel opposes using Hextech weaponry. A despondent Vi refuses Caitlyn’s offer to join the enforcers, recalling the enforcers killing her parents during Vander’s last riot attempt. After learning from junior officer Maddie Nolan that Caitlyn vouched for her following Jayce’s attack in Zaun, Vi attends the memorial for the fallen councilors. The memorial is attacked by Chem-Baroness Renni in revenge for Jayce killing her son. Vi, Caitlyn, and the enforcers fight Renni and her crew until Ambessa and her soldiers arrive and kill them. Realizing that the use of Hextech weaponry is inevitable, Jayce begins developing new arms and provides Caitlyn, now promoted to Commander, with a custom rifle. Caitlyn assembles a task force, including Vi, to confront Jinx and the remaining Chem-Barons. Meanwhile, Singed finds a pair of wolves in a cave and prepares to use a toxic gas canister on them.

[thunder rumbling]
[footsteps approaching]
She was a great woman.
A good friend.
I don’t know how we’ll face this crisis without her.
[door clunks]
[wheels squeaking]
To think we nearly extended sovereignty
to the creatures who did this.
We’re charged with imposing order.
And we’ve been asleep at our posts.
Well, my eyes are open.
There will be no more fairy tales of peace until we scour our basement of its demons.
So kind of you to assist Councilor Salo, Mother.
As we are at war,
I thought it prudent to solicit the advice of such an experienced veteran.
Let us address the matter at hand.
Our people are scared, suffering.
They need to know their leaders have the situation under control.
An unprecedented show of force.
We flood the undercity with Enforcers, armed with Hextech.




Innocents will be caught in the cross fire.
How many more councilors have to be blown to pieces before you wake up?
We are under siege.
What is she doing here?
Officer Kiramman witnessed the attack firsthand.
She confirmed this was the act of a single deranged individual.
Jinx.
[Mel] Silco is dead.
The underground, leaderless.
If we follow your plan, we risk unifying them against us.
So, what is your solution? Chastisement?
A firm reprimand?
We use their division against them.
Pin the attack on Jinx,
post a reward too substantial to ignore.
I’m sorry, Mel. I’m not comfortable trusting our fates to chance.
Jinx has proven elusive.
Our healing can only begin once she’s been brought to justice.
Then it’s settled, 2 to 1.
We invade.
[sighs]
If I may? In crises such as these,
it’s imperative you present a unified front to the public,
whatever your personal feelings.
How wise.




I’ll agree to endorse the invasion.
But I draw the line at Hextech.
We have an ethos.
Such force must be a final resort.
Agreed.
[thunder crashes]
Then it’s settled, 2 to 1.
[thunder rumbling]
[melancholy music playing]
[footsteps approaching]
I had the shot.
Your mother left this to you.
[Caitlyn] The Kiramman Key?
No, I’m not…
I don’t deserve it.
It’s your legacy now, Caitlyn.
What is she still doing here?
Hey.
[Caitlyn sobbing]
You were right, Cait.
Powder’s gone.
I can make this right.
If you get Jayce to fix the gauntlets, I can do this myself.
No one else needs to get hurt.
No.
No more rogue mission.
No more reckless plans.
My mother was right.
My arrogance led me to take on more than I could handle,
and she paid the price.
They’re sending all the Enforcers after Jinx.
I’m going with them.
Please, I have to help.
You can.
As one of us.
Cait, I can’t wear this.
People are calling for blood.
The Council won’t stop them.
You can show that not all of Zaun supports Jinx.
We can show them.
Together.
I watched them kill my parents.
Do you have any idea how that feels?
Yes. I do.
I thought you were on our side.
You didn’t think at all.
[yells]
[man grunts]
[man] Hey, watch it.
Sorry.




[man] Not my first.
You all right?
[sighs, then grunts]
You, uh…
lose someone in the attack?
[somber music playing]
[liquid burbling]
How is he?
Same as before. Breathing.
Pulse is consistent.
Beyond that,
your guess is good as mine.
[gasps]
What’s it doing to him?
The Hexcore has been evolving.
Shifting through runic patterns faster than I can keep up.
All I know for certain is that it’s keeping him alive.
It’s the sort of puzzle Viktor would love if he wasn’t…
It should be me up there instead of him.
Don’t say that.
He’ll come back to us.
[Jayce] I still don’t understand.
He was right next to me.
How does the explosion do that to him, and I just…?
I just walk out without a scratch?
There’s no sense to these things, Jayce.
How’d it go with the Council?
[scoffs] My mother’s entered the game.
She’s already gotten her hooks into Salo.
Using his grief to make a play for Hextech.
Mel, I promised Viktor,
never again.
It’s all right.
I handled it.
I won’t let them corrupt your dream.
Caitlyn was there.
You might pay her a visit.
She hides it admirably, but the poor girl’s in so much pain.
[wind chimes tinkling]
[ethereal music playing]
[distant laughter]
[Jayce] Hey, Sprout.
[footsteps approaching]
How’d you find me?
Your dad.
Mother and I used to come here when we needed an escape.
[chuckles dryly] One of the few places we never argued.
I’m sorry I haven’t been around.
How’s Viktor?
[Jayce sighs]




I can’t even tell if he’s still in there.
Ever since it happened…
three faces keep spinning through my mind.
I see Mother.
When they found her.
And every fiber of me just sinks,
like a stone swallowed in dark water.
But then there’s Jinx.
Laughing.
I want to tear that laugh from her throat forever.
Cait.
I know.
I just understand now
how easy it is to hate them.
One vicious act.
Then I see Vi.
I asked her to put on the uniform.
Suffice to say, she declined.
Vi? Wear a badge?
She thinks those gauntlets of yours will solve all her problems.
What if she’s right?
Hextech may keep us alive, Jayce,
but it’s not what will save us.
Me.
Join the peanut patrol. Ha.
And I thought she had no sense of humor.
[man yawns] I like peanuts.
Her dad’s right.
There’s no point in sticking around up here.
Except…
I’m the one who created the monster.
[woman] Vi?
Who are you? And how do you know my name?
Junior Officer Nolen.
Maddie.
And, uh…
it’s written on your face.
[scoffs]
So, what is it?
Random search?
Escort off the property?
Or you just here to waste my time?
Search? No.
No, no. Heh.
Uh, you’re something of a legend amongst the Enforcers.
Caitlyn made quite a scene at the station when they tried to deny your enlistment.
Now I have to ask,
is it all true?
You went after Silco alone when the Council wouldn’t back you?
Took on his whole gang?
Cait said all that?
She said if every Enforcer had a heart like yours,
we could take on Noxus itself.
[Maddie chuckles]
Then she threatened to withdraw her family’s funding.
Anyhow, I’m glad you’re joining up.
Hmm.
[Maddie] After the sheriff betrayed us…
Well, let’s just say…
it’s nice to know there are still good ones left.
[fanfare playing]
[man] Officer Nolen.
[Maddie] Duty calls.
A real honor, Vi.
[snoring]
[sighs]
[snoring]
[solemn music playing]
Go ahead, ma’am.
This way, ma’am.
Stop.
[guard] Please keep moving, folks.
Mm-hm.
One of the many privileges of serving as your councilor
is having the occasion now and again to stand behind this podium
to behold so many
joined together not by birth or dictum but by all that we share.
Our hope.
Our curiosity.
Our compulsion to leave behind us a world better than that before.
These things we share are what make us one people.
Today we share an unthinkable loss.
Councilor Irius Bolbok,
Councilor Torman Hoskel,
and Councilor Cassandra Kiramman were taken from us.
But they shall not be forgotten.
We commissioned this statue
so we may remember them for their countless contributions…
their lifetimes of service.
Not for the craven act that stole them away.
[guard] Ma’am, you can’t go in…
[distorted dialogue]
[Mel] Though we’ve suffered a terrible blow,
I assure you, the rule of law prevails in Piltover.
No.
[Mel] We will find those responsible.
And they will account for their crimes.
Awful, isn’t it?
Losing a loved one.
[gasps]
[crowd screaming]
[dramatic music playing]
[leader] You aren’t safe up here, toppers.
None of you are safe.
[screams]
[man] Look out!
[crowd screaming]
[roars]
[gasping]
[growls]
Go.
[screams]
[yells]
[yells]
[solemn music playing]
Get the counselors out of here.
I have an idea.
What are you doing?
[suspenseful music playing]
[growls]
[heavy footsteps from above]
[screaming]
[laughs]
[dramatic music playing]
[screams]
For my son.
[groans]
[solemn music playing]
[metal creaking]
[Vi] Come on.
Shit.
[both yelling]
[somber music playing]
[Enforcer 1] Perimeter secured.
We’ll see.
Thought you were gonna get yourself killed.
[child sobbing]
[Enforcer 2] Here, come with me.
A memorial.
I got you.
What kind of animals?
They wanted the spectacle.
They’re trying to scare you.
All they did is piss me off.
You…
You need to find a way to call off the invasion.
What?
This battle was on your soil.
Down there, you’ll be on their terms.
None of this is on our terms.
[Vi] Maybe you should change that.
I don’t know how, okay?
She dies and leaves this giant hole,
and I’m just supposed to fill it.
Like she was never there to begin with.
[Vi] Hey.
You won’t.
The hole gets smaller, but…
you never fill it.
I was wrong to spring the badge on you.
It’s just…
every way I slice it,
if I go after your sister alone,
one of us comes back in a box.
It’s all coming apart.
[Vi] No, it isn’t.
We won’t let it.
[moody music playing]
[Cassandra] I know you doubt the merit of your birthright, Caitlyn.
There’s wisdom in that.
But remember:
You’re a Kiramman.
♪ This is what you ask for ♪
♪ Heavy is the crown ♪
♪ Fire in the sun As ash is raining down ♪
♪ Try to hold it in ♪

♪ Heavy is the crown ♪
Never in our lifetimes has Piltover’s leadership been forced
into the dungeons of our capitol.
But here we are.
Does anyone still doubt that our enemy is greater than one deranged individual?
How did they sneak so many of these things into the ceremony?
I thought we took every measure to secure it.
They must have had help.
From someone up here.
[Salo] We can’t afford any more handwringing.
If we do not defend ourselves with Hextech,
our principles will mean nothing.
I…
[door opens]
[Caitlyn] We aren’t prepared for a full-scale invasion.
The undercity’s attack proved that.
This is a closed Council meeting. Who let you in here?
I am a decorated officer.
Leader of House Kiramman.
Address me with respect, or keep your mouth shut.
I will lead a strike team into Zaun with three objectives: locate Jinx, dismantle Shimmer, and neutralize any agents still loyal to Silco.
What makes you think you’ll fare better than our forces today?
[Caitlyn] We’ve got a few surprises of our own.

[glass shatters]
[guest screams]
Fuck. Fuck.
[breathing shakily] Fuck. Oh, God.
Okay. Holy shit. [whimpers] No.
[panting, speaks indistinctly]
[panting, whimpering]
[sighs] For Christ’s sake.
[panting]
Hey.
[whimpers]
[sobs]
Holy shit.
[whimpers]
Oh, G…
[strains, panting]
[grunting]
[panting]
[whimpers]
No.
[breathing shakily]
[phone chimes]




[panting]
[feedback tone]
[automated voice] We’re sorry,
you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.
Please check the number and try your call again.
[crying]
[phone rings]
[screams, panting]
Hello. [panting]
[caller] How did you get this number?
I was told that if I ever needed help, serious help, to call you.
Let me ask you again. How did you get this number?
He said you’d ask that,
the man who gave it to me, and he said not to say.
That doesn’t make very much sense, does it?
How do I know that I can trust you
if you won’t tell me who gave you this number?
He said to say there’s only one man in the city who can do what you do.
He said, “That man is an expert. That man is a professional.”
And he said you can never predict the future
and that maybe one day, I may need that one man.
And that one man is you.
[caller] Where are you?
And what happened?
Okay. And you’re sure?




All right.
Now, what I need you to do is gonna be difficult, but you can do it, okay?
I need you to activate the do-not-disturb light for your room
and then do absolutely nothing till I get there. You understand?
Good. You’re not to leave the room. You’re not to make any phone calls.
You’re not to touch anything. You’re not to answer the door.
You’re not to pour yourself a drink to steady your nerves.
You understand? Repeat that back to me.
Okay. That’s great. You’re doing great. Yes, I’ll be there as quickly as possible.
How will you know it’s me? This is how you’ll know it’s me.
[knocks on door rhythmically]
Everything’s gonna be fine. I’ll be there before you know it.
[billiards clacking]
[“No Ordinary Love” playing]
[breathing shakily]
[knocks on door rhythmically]
[gasps]
[breathes shakily]
Co-Come in.
Did you talk to anyone?
No.
Call anyone?
No. No one.
Text? Any kind of communication at all?
No. Nothing. I sat there just like you said.




Okay. Good. You can pour yourself that drink now.
Oh. Yeah. A-Any kind?
Strong is probably best.
Okay. [stammers] Do you want something?
Thanks, no.
Does anybody know you’re here?
I don’t think so, no.
You don’t think so?
[stammers] No. No one knows I’m here.
What about the room?
Did anyone recognize you when you checked in?
No. I used an alias. I always do.
I mean, anytime I get a hotel room. Not when I’m…
I understand. That’s good.
I got the room right after I met… [stammers]
I made him wait by the elevator so no one would…
[breathes heavily] I don’t do this.
[sobs] This isn’t something I do.
All right, listen. I want you to look at the time.
Is there anyone that would be concerned that they haven’t heard from you yet?
Oh, God. I don’t kn…
Think.
Uh, n-no. I generally go and do as I please.
Good. I understand.
And you can make all of this go away?




That’s why you called me.
[breathing shakily]
He was jumping on the bed.
Mmm.
And he fell and crashed into the glass.
This would be the end.
Everything I’ve worked so hard to build.
Okay.
And we’re on the verge of doing something truly important.
All right. We don’t have time for that. We don’t have much time at all.
It wasn’t my fault. I didn’t do anything…
None of it matters. It doesn’t matter, okay?
No, no. You listen to me.
You need to know this. I didn’t do anything. We were…
If you weren’t here right now, where would you be?
What? What do you mean?
If this was a normal night,
and you weren’t in a $10,000 penthouse suite
with a dead prostitute face down in a pool of blood and broken glass,
where would you be?
He was not a prostitute.
Home. I would be home working, watching TV with my daughter…
Okay. Good. That’s where I want you to be now.
Okay.
Okay.
You’re home. You’re sitting on the couch. What’s your daughter’s name?
I have two daughters.
[stammers] Julia. That’s who I would…
All right. You’re watching TV with Julia.
Okay.
I will make sure that none of this gets traced back to you in any way.
Like it never happened. Whatever it takes. No matter what.
[sighs] Thank you.
That’s the job.
When I was given your number, I thought it was a joke.
I didn’t know people like you really existed.
They don’t. There’s nobody who can do what I do.
[inhales deeply, sighs]
[grunting, breathing deeply]
[knocks on door]
What was that?
[whispering] Say, “Hello.”
What?
Say, “Hello.”
Hello.
Louder.
Hello?
[stammers] No service, please. Thank you.
[card reader beeps]
[gasps]




[door opens]
[door closes]
[sighs]
[clears throat]
[breathes deeply]
Mmm.
Can I help you?
I don’t think so, no.
[grunts]
Who are you?
I’m here to take care of your problem. Who is he?
I called him.
Ah.
Who called you?
Son of a bitch.
[phone rings]
Hmm.
W-What’s going on?
Yeah.
Got it.
He does. I know. It’s weird. Okay.
What?
Hello? Who is this?
Oh. Oh. Okay.
Okay. Yes.
[guest speaks indistinctly]
[breathes deeply]
[surveillant] Mm-hmm. I completely understand. And I have no doubt
that we can come to some sort of agreement that satisfies us both.
Well, I hardly think you’re in a position to be negotiating anything.
Uh-huh.
Fair point. That is a fair point.
So, tell me, what would you suggest?
…illegal camera up there?
Got a hidden fucking camera. That’s illegal surveillance.
That’s a class D felony in the state of New York. A class D felony.
You’re more than welcome to leave, sir. Your services are no longer required.
Come on.
What’s the play here?
I don’t know what you’re talking about, sir.
What?
You did check to see if…
Okay, you’re on speaker.
[phone chimes]
[surveillant] Hello? Are the men there?
Can you hear me?
Yes, they’re here.
Wonderful.
Now then, we clearly have a situation here, and time’s of the essence.
So, I’m not going to mince words.




My name is Pamela Dowd-Herdry.
This is my hotel. It’s very new.
It’s very expensive, and I have a clear,
vested interest in minimizing any sort of controversy associated with it.
I am very aware of the stigma that can become attached to a building,
and I’m not interested in being the owner of a hotel where a district attorney,
whom I greatly admire and whose work I believe in very much,
was found with a dead prostitute.
He wasn’t…
So that being said, I have brought in someone I know
through a trusted friend to take care of this problem.
He is an expert. He is the very best there is.
There is, quite simply, no one else out there who can do what he does.
Thank you, Pam.
Now, of course, my guest has her own interests at stake as well
and feels the need to make sure those interests are protected,
which is why she has insisted on maintaining her own person…
Mmm.
…to ensure this problem goes away.
And as we have reached an impasse
as to whose man would be better suited to accomplish the task,
we have decided that the only course of action is for you both to work together
to clean up this absolute fucking clusterfuck of a mess.
Hello?
[both] No.
[phone beeps]
Pam, I’d like to have a word.
Please, wait. Please.
No. No.
[guest] Wait a minute.
You’re joking, right? This a joke.
You can’t just leave.
This is not how I work.
How do I know I can trust him? I don’t…
Know this guy.
Well, sure, maybe. Or maybe he’s just some knucklehead.
You don’t know me. How do you know you can trust me?
I don’t, but I trust the man who gave me your number because…
Careful.
Because when he says something, it has value, and he said I could trust you.
Well, Pam, I don’t see how that has anything to do with me, does it?
Are you appealing to my sense of honor? Because that’s not how this works.
This is not how I work.
He said if you take the job, you give your word.
And that word’s the measure of a man.
Not like this.
You’re on those tapes too.
Forget about me.
If you… If you don’t finish the job, she’s got you on camera.
[sighs]
Pa…
I know you can see me.
Fine.
[sighs]
The feeling’s mutual.
[guest breathes deeply] Okay.
[sighs] So, now what?
Well, I need to know…
Well, the first thing I need t…
[sighs]
I-I need to know everything you did tonight.
Starting from when?
Starting from when things went from a normal night to this.
Sit down.
[guest] Oh.
All right.
Uh, I was at an event a few blocks away.
After it was over, I wanted a drink. I like the bar here.
I had just walked in
and was headed for the ladies’ room when this kid started talking to me.
H-He was funny, and he was charming, and he was so out of place.
And I just said, you know, “Do you wanna get a room?”
It was a… sort of a joke, sort of not.
Mmm.
He said, “Sure.”
And you never met him before?
No.
No one saw you together?
No.
And then you came upstairs.
I don’t understand why you need to know all this.
Because I need to know what I need to make disappear.
[Pam’s man] We.
What?
We need to know.
So, you came upstairs.
We were drinking and fooling around…
Excuse me. When exactly did you get the room?
Before I came upstairs.
Before she came upstairs.
Before you met the kid or after you met the kid?
After I met the kid. Before I came upstairs.
O-Okay, thank you. I didn’t know. Proceed.
So, you were drinking and fooling around.
Was there ever a discussion of money?
He’s not a prostitute.
[sighs]
No. Hey! I already… God.
This is already fucking embarrassing and humiliating enough as it is.
I don’t understand why I have to answer everything twice.
You don’t have to answer everything twice.
You might have to answer a few things twice.
Jesus Christ, will you…
Jesus Christ, do I know what the two of you have spoken about?
No, I do not. I am trying to get up to speed.
So you brought this 20-something…
[stammers] …non-prostitute up to your room.
You began drinking, fooling around, and…
He goes into the bathroom, and he comes out,
he starts jumping up on the fucking bed,
and he falls backwards onto the fucking bar cart, and fucking drops dead.
[breathes deeply]
Is there anyone who might be concerned they haven’t heard from you tonight?
[guest’s man] Gonna get cleaned up.
Gonna take your things, and you’re gonna leave.
Uh, I’m covered in blood.
You’re gonna go home, and you’re gonna see your family,
act like nothing ever happened.
What?
Um, did you by chance…
So, you’ll be in touch to coordinate the, uh…
Don’t worry about it. That time will come, but not now.
And what exactly will happen to him?
To who?
Right.
Okay.
[guest] Hey, sweetie, did you eat?
I’m on my way home. I can pick up some food.
[lock clicks]
[can opens]
[Pam’s man sighs]
[slurps]
[sighs]
What are you doing?
Mmm. [sighs]
You know, I was giving you the benefit of the doubt,
letting you clean up unsupervised.
Unsupervised? Wow, that’s an honor.
I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding
of what is happening here.
Do I?
Yes.
I wanna finish the job and go home.
Mmm. And that is where there is a fundamental misunderstanding.
Mmm. Enlighten me.
Well, your job is to make sure that
that mess behind you cannot be traced back to your client,
and to do that, you have to make sure that that mess disappears completely.
As if it never happened. Difficult.
For you, maybe.
Well, that’s irrelevant.
Because my job is to make sure that you do your job
so that that mess cannot be traced back to this hotel.
Less difficult.
So, you’re just gonna sit there and slurp your soda?
I’m going to…
supervise.
[slurping]
Fuck you.
Mmm.
Just don’t touch anything.
[grunting]
You’re gonna get blood on your sweater.
I won’t get blood on my sweater.
[guest’s man sighs]
[grunts]
[sighs]
Thanks.
[guest’s man groaning] Dump the body. Finish the job. Supervise.
[sighs]
[sighs]
[joints cracking]
[groans, sighs]
[toy squeaks]
Oh, shit.
I told you not to touch anything.
[sighs]
Oh, shit.
Mmm.
[sighs]
It’s gonna be a long fucking night.
[phone rings]
[Pam] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I don’t understand.
Why can’t you simply dispose of the drugs as well?
Cops find a dead kid in the park…
There’s zero reason why a kid…
…overdosed…
…like that would be walking around…
…they’re asking questions.
…with this much product…
which means it’s probably stolen.
So, whoever it does belong to will be looking for it. In my experience,
it’s not the kind of people you want knocking on the door of your hotel!
[Pam] I have no clue what either one of you just said.
It strikes me that whoever those belong to is going to wonder what happened to them.
I don’t want whoever that is showing up here,
and I certainly don’t want to take responsibility
for throwing their product into the river or turning it over to the police.
So this is what you’ll do.
You’ll find out who those drugs belong to,
and you’ll return them.
[line clicks]
Uh, no…
Look, Pam, it’s not… [sighs]
It’s not that simple. [sighs]
Could’ve been a tracker in there.
Tracker.
You don’t think they’d already be here if there was a…
[breathes deeply]
How the hell are we gonna figure out who this belongs to?
Body first, then the drugs.
Listen, if I were you, I’d…
You’re not.
Hey, I don’t want this to take all night.
It won’t.
Okay then, so…
Oh, now you wanna get involved? Fuck you.
Hey, you wanna help?
Why don’t you call your boss and have her clear out the parking garage?
We can take the body down in the tarp.
You’re joking.
You have to clean the surveillance anyway. No one’s gonna see it.
Oh, I get it.
What?
Nothing.
Just lucky for you, I’m here, otherwise you’re caught.
I get it.
I’m trying to save time.
No, it’s okay. You don’t have to explain.
You can’t do it. I’m gonna help you out.
I can do it.
Really?
Yeah, really.
So do it.
Maybe I don’t want you to see how I do it.
Whatever you say.
Hey… [stammers] …you know what? Don’t call your boss. Don’t call.
Fuck it. Like I need your fucking help.
Okay, I’ll fucking do it.
Well, that’s one way to do it.
Looks like a dead body on a luggage cart.
I’m not finished yet.
Huh.
[guest’s man] Here’s a lesson.
You don’t have to help. I don’t need you to help…
Hmm.
…but if you do, it’ll go faster.
I am enjoying the show.
[grunts]
[sighs]
Thanks.
Happy to help.
Dick.
Putz.
[elevator dings]
Wait.
What?
The parking garage is on a different security system.
You’re an asshole.
I just wanted to see how an old man would do it,
but your secret’s safe with me.
[grunts]
It’s the red one.
[grunts]
[electricity crackles]
[guard] What?
[door opens, closes]
Hmm.
That should buy you an extra five.
[guest’s man] I don’t need an extra fucking five.
I have a fob.
[“Smooth Operator” playing]
[Pam’s man] I have a fob.
[music stops]
Just don’t interfere.
The old cone in the gate?
Another trade secret?
Let’s wipe the tapes and go.
No.
No?
Although I am curious to see
how you would’ve navigated this next situation without me,
I’m afraid I have to do this one alone.
Excuse me?
I will wipe the tapes.
I just can’t let you watch.
Yeah. This is a two-way street.
I was told specifically to make sure you do not see this.
By who? Your boss?
She doesn’t want you back there.
You got hidden cameras in a brand-new, luxury hotel.
What kind of a scam are you running here?
You’re not going back there.
Really? Why?
What are you hiding? Who are you exactly?
Who am I? Fuck you, who am I. Who are you?
Some old bagman? Some old cleaner?
Yeah.
I’m not letting you in there.
That’s some big talk coming from a hotel policeman.
Big talk coming from the A/V club.
I’m on those tapes and I’m not leaving until I’m not.
No one gives a shit if you’re on those tapes.
How do you and I know it’s not some kind of a setup?
Oh, please.
How?
Setup, how?
Maybe your boss brought that kid here on purpose.
Go on.
Yeah.
Maybe she brought him ’cause she knows he’s got drugs.
Or she gave him the drugs, and she’s setting both of them up.
They’re having a good time,
they’re drinking, they’re laughing, all of that.
But she wants him to overdose, and she’s got it on tape.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Then she makes a deal with my boss
to clean the whole thing up like it never happened.
But she keeps the tape.
For what?
For leverage, you dumbass.
Leverage for what, dipshit?
You tell me, asshole.
That makes no fucking sense.
You’ve seen too many movies.
Fucking putz.
Oh, I…
[wheezing]
Shit.
Fuck.
[door opens]
Shit.
Fuck.
[wheezing]
[grunts]
[guard] You okay?
All good.
[Pam’s man] Yep.
[guest’s man chuckles]
That doesn’t make sense, he wasn’t breathing.
[stammers]
You didn’t check his pulse?
Fuck you, I didn’t check his pulse. He didn’t have a fucking pulse.
And yet…
And yet you didn’t check his pulse, you didn’t ask.
It’s the first thing you do.
He didn’t have a fucking pulse.
And yet…
And yet, you didn’t ask.
You didn’t say, “Is he dead?”
I didn’t think I had to.
You think I didn’t check his pulse?
No, I do not. I think you got rattled. I think you forgot.
Bush-league is what you are.
You walk into a situation,
you see two people standing there, one on the floor.
You don’t ask, “Does he have a pulse?”
You don’t ask, “Is he dead?” You check for yourself.
Thank you, sensei.
Yeah.
I mean, maybe it was the drugs. I don’t know.
Oh, that’s just lazy bullshit. It doesn’t work that way.
Well, he’s not dead.
It would appear not.
[breathes deeply]
Just admit you didn’t check.
Oh, just shut up. I’m trying to think.
Oh, it was a magic drug
that makes your heartbeat so slow…
[stammers] Would you shut the fuck up?
It doesn’t matter.
This is a different thing now.
[sighs]
[Pam’s man] Wait, this is great.
Think about it. He’s gotta know.
We need to go. We need to hurry.
It’s not a guarantee.
I know, but we need to go now before his brain turns into applesauce.
Brain probably already is applesauce.
Listen, I don’t wanna have to go door-to-door
like some fucking Jehovah’s Witness
trying to return four fucking bricks of God-knows-what-did-that-to-him, do you?
Was that your plan?
[sighs] I’m trying to make a point.
It is worth a shot.
I agree.
Okay, then. I know someone.
Fuck no.
What? My guy’s good.
Fuck your guy. Some bullet puller.
The only way that’d go is sideways.
Fuck you. We’re using my guy.
It only works with my guy. It’s exclusive.
My car, my guy. Fuck you.
Fucking…
And?
Didn’t pick up. Where we going?
Chinatown.
Take a right out of the exit and that’ll take you…
I know how to get to Chinatown.
Mm-hmm.
[“Smooth Operator” continues playing]
[sighs]
[glove box opens, closes]
[music stops]
The Albanians.
What?
The Albanians had this thing a while back.
Yeah, I know.
Massive shipment of pure, uncut heroin
en route from Europe suddenly just disappears.
I know.
You think those bricks came from their shipment?
You should just take them back yourself.
No.
I’m not interested in being murdered, is what I’m saying.
The Albanians will kill
and have killed anybody they even suspect of stealing that shipment.
So, whoever did it, sends this kid in to be a honeypot
to seduce my client to get some political flex,
to crack down on the Albanians to clear the playing field to sell the drugs.
So, they send in the kid with the backpack.
They want him to take the drugs, they want him to overdose,
and… [sighs]
[stammers]
No, it doesn’t work.
Keep at it. You’ll crack it eventually.
[phone rings]
[sighs]
[phone rings]
Left on Division.
[sighing]
[exclaims] I gotta clear you first.
Okay.
Can’t just waltz up there with a guy…
Okay.
[sighs]
[physician] Nope, not tonight.
It’s not about that.
I’m sure it’s not.
Come on, really. This is real. I need help.
What kind of help?
Well…
[no audible dialogue]
So, um, yeah.
[physician] Hold on, I’m coming down.
[sniffs]
[door buzzes, opens]
What happens to the kid after he talks?
If he talks, my job’s done.
So, this other guy kills him?
[sighs]
[scoffs]
[physician] Do you vouch for him?
He’s been all right.
I’m not gonna vouch for him. I… You know, can’t go that far.
He’s like… You know…
He’s like one of those guys, you know?
No, I-I don’t know. One of what guys?
One of those guys who thinks he’s, like, some genius.
Got it all figured out, you know?
Yeah, I’m familiar with that type.
I don’t wanna fix this kid up just so you can put a bullet in his…
He’s had his moment, you know, where he was the go-to guy,
the hot-shit guy, but that wore off a long time ago,
and no one’s told him yet.
[footsteps approaching]
Probably lives in a single-bedroom apartment,
watching old black-and-white movies till he falls asleep ’cause he’s so lonely.
Hello, June.
[sighs]
Hello.
You didn’t pick up.
I know.
Mmm.
Is there really a kid in your trunk?
How long have you two been…
Not what you think.
You told him it was exclusive.
Oh, are there more?
Is there an OD’ing kid in your trunk? Because if there is, then this…
Was he before me?
Yes.
Yes?
Yes?
No. Yes?
Yes.
Then can we take care of the OD’ing kid first, you fucking lunatics?
[guest’s man] Hmm.
You need to be careful. Both of you need to be.
There are people out there. If they saw you two together, I…
You said it was exclusive.
[groans]
What? You did!
[sighs]
[guest’s man] Shit.
[wheezes]
Come on, bring him in here.
[June] And careful of your back.
[both] Yep.
All right. On three. You ready?
Wait. One, two, three, right? Not one, two, three, go?
Of course not.
Good.
One, two, three.
[grunts]
[wheezing]
Do you know what he took?
No.
I’m not sure.
Well, it must have been some bad combination
or something extremely pure.
God, it’s like he doesn’t even have a heartbeat.
I know a lot of paramedics would have called him.
Oh, really?
We just need him to talk.
Let me get this straight.
You’re saying it’s like he took some kind of a magic drug?
So, how many…
Makes your heartbeat so slow that…
How many clowns you got running through this joint?
[sighs] Now is… It’s really not the time.
Why didn’t you pick up when I called?
Okay, both of you out. Now.
[stammers, sighs]
Out.
[“O Come Let Us Adore Him” playing]
[Pam’s man sighs]
[sighing]
Did you know?
I had my suspicions.
Yeah.
Never saw anyone, never heard anything, so I didn’t ask.
If it makes you feel any better, she is the best.
Sure.
[chuckles]
My first guy, I came in to get a bullet pulled out of my side,
and he wants to put me under.
I said, “Fuck no.”
Come to find out,
he’s taking people’s kidneys without asking them.
People are waking up and thinking,
“Hey, that’s a big scar for getting a bullet pulled.”
She saved my life.
No kidding.
Yeah. Shrapnel, inch away from my spine.
Spent two weeks in the basement recovering.
Back in October?
Maybe. How would you know that?
I was here.
Come on.
I was wondering why she didn’t let me near the cellar.
She is the best.
She is.
I guess I knew it wasn’t exclusive.
What are the odds?
Right?
Both of us sleeping with the same Chinatown doctor.
Oh, were you… you two not…
[door opens]
[screams]
[bottles clattering]
Stop him!
[grunts, exclaiming]
[horn honks]
[grunts]
[brakes squeal]
[sighs]
Go right at the…

Get in the car.
[stammers, grunts, groans]
Fucker.
[driver] Hey, asshole! What are you doing?
Come on.
[grunts]
[kid panting]
Who are you guys?
[intercom buzzes]
[line clicks]
[June] No!
Come on. We just need to… [sighs]
[June] No!
[buzzing continues]
[window opens]
[June] Hey! Dum-dums!
Uh, catch.
Take two of the big ones every couple of hours
and one of the small ones every six. And lots of water.
Also, I’m not sleeping with him. He’s just fucking with you.
Yeah. I was just fucking with you.
[kid panting]
No.
Come on. You got a place.
Maybe I do.
Of course you do.
[thudding]
Knock it off!
You know what you sound like?
What?
You sound like a guy who’s got a place.
[scoffs]
You got a place. Let’s go to your place.
We’re not going to my place.
Why not?
That’s the point of having a place.
Exactly.
[breathes shakily]
[inhales sharply] Okay. [pants]
[car door closes]
What the fuck? [pants]
Get dressed.
Come on.
Come on.
[preacher on TV] So that all those who come to Christ may enter into his kingdom.
Need a room.
Love Nest, Arabian Nights, or Safari?
Excuse me?
Love Nest, Arabian Nights, or Safari?
Love Nest, Arabian Nights are three minimum.
Safari I can do by the hour.
[preacher] Into the family of God and are sanctified.
[sighs] He’s not a prostitute.
[kid groans]
Sit down.
[sighs] So, uh, how do you wanna do this?
‘Cause I’ve never really done it like this be…
I mean, I could start, I guess, and then… [stammers]
Then I just jump in when it feels right.
Yeah. Unless you wanna start and then…
No, you go. You go. You got this. I’ll just, uh, follow your lead.
Mmm.
Okay.
Mm-hmm. [sighs]
Where…
So…
Hmm.
Where’d you get the drugs?
[chuckles] I don’t know what you’re talking about.
[guest’s man] Mm-hmm. Okay.
Where’d you get the drugs?
[chuckles] I don’t know.
I don’t know anything about any drugs.
Where did you get the drugs?
[kid] I don’t…
Talk, asshole.
Show him the rest.
Come on.
[sighs, groans]
[scoffs]
[Pam’s man] Huh?
Now.
[sighs]
Those aren’t mine.
Can I talk to you in the hall, just for a minute?
[grunts, groans]
What the fuck do you think you’re doing?
You asked the same thing three times. I thought this could…
He didn’t know we had the drugs. He was panicked. We had leverage.
He wasn’t panicked. He wasn’t gonna say anything.
You don’t know that.
How many times were you gonna ask?
Ten times? Twenty time… Hey!
You know, there’s an art to this you may not realize.
What, the art of saying the same thing over and over?
Okay. Well, let’s see your technique.
I’m not gonna show you my technique.
Because you don’t have a technique.
No.
No? Then why?
Because you’ll steal it.
I’ll steal it? You think I’ll steal it?
There you go, repeating again.
You don’t have a technique.
I do, and it involves a little bit more
than saying the same thing over and over again.
[sighs]
I showed you my luggage cart trick.
You didn’t show me. I saw it.
Yeah, but you liked it. You’ll use it.
Maybe.
Mmm. Come on. Admit it. It was cool.
Okay, fine. It was very cool.
Yeah, it’s cool.
So, what’s the next move here?
Can’t we just get to it?
What do you mean?
Like, I don’t wanna be here.
[person moaning]
Hmm. You miss your place?
I feel like I’m getting syphilis just standing here. Let’s just get to it.
Really?
Why not?
Hmm. Let’s get to it.
Great.
Where’d you get the fucking drugs?
…the fucking drugs, you asshole?
[screams] Lagrange!
They call him Lagrange!
Lagrange?
What about him?
They’re his… or they were… the drugs.
Bullshit. How?
How? What do you mean? How-How what?
How does someone like you get involved with one of the biggest
drug runners in the city?
Yeah.
Well… So, I’m not a prostitute, okay. That’s n… That’s not what’s happening.
How did you get the drugs?
Fuck you! I’m fucking trying to explain. Just let me explain. Let me explain, okay?
[breathes heavily] Can I get a glass of water?
[sighs]
[kid breathing heavily]
I mean, she did say hydrate.
Yeah, I know. I…
[stammers] Fine. Fine. Fuck it.
Thank you.
Yeah.
[animal sounds playing through speaker]
Ugh.
[sighs]
[animals sounds continue]
[Pam’s man sighs]
[grunts]
[sighs]
[grunting, groans]
Thank you.
[breathes deeply, swallows] Mmm.
[swallows] Mmm.
[swallows] Oh, boy.
[swallows, sighs] Oh, my goodness.
[swallows] Mmm.
[swallows] Mmm.
[swallows, grunts]
[slurps, swallows]
[burps, clears throat] Okay.
[breathes deeply]
So, I wake up…
Jesus Christ, kid. You woke up… You gotta start the story there?
Just let him talk.
I… [stammers] Yeah.
It’s not gonna make sense unless I tell you the whole thing.
So, you think you need to add in the detail
that you woke up in case it wasn’t clear?
Yes, I do. It’s how I started my day.
That’s how everyone starts their day!
What he’s saying is take a minute to think about what’s
the most important part of the story and leave the rest out.
Well, uh, I…
[guest’s man] Hey!
Think about it.
Right. [stammers] Um…
Well, so I’m… I’m-I’m-I’m… I’m getting up
and I’m… I’m getting out of bed and, um… Uh… [exhales sharply]
…you know, my room is a mess and I’m-I’m… I’m not exactly hungover,
but I’m still feeling a little bit… Shit!
Fuck! Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay. I-I-I… Yes.
Oh, I leave my house and…
No.
All right. Just let him do the whole thing. He can’t do it.
I… No, I can do it.
No, you can’t do it.
Yeah, I can.
[sighs] Just go fast, all right?
Okay. Yes. I, uh…
Now, what the fuck happened?
[kid] Yes. Okay. So, I’m, like…
I wasn’t trying to make any money or anything, like, be a drug dealer.
Like, I-I’ve been taking classes at Pace. I’ve been trying to learn business.
Some… Some business classes ’cause, you know,
people are gonna try and fuck you with, like, law and legal shit unless, you know,
you know how it works. So, I’m taking these classes,
and there’s this dude there and he’s, like, legit.
He is from some real shit but he’s, like, so smart also.
I mean he’s, like, basically a genius smart, and today his fucking mom died.
Like, he got this call in class and his fucking mom was in the hospital,
and she fucking died because they didn’t,
like, give her the right medicine or some shit.
Like, they fucked up.
So I’m just like, “Dude, whatever you need, dude.”
And he, like, trusts me. Like, we hang out and shit.
And I told you he’s legit, like, no fucking around.
So, he’s like… [stammers]
he’s like, “I’m supposed to do this drop for my boss and now I can’t.”
And I was like, “Say no more, I will do it.”
Like, I don’t do this kind of shit.
So he gives me the shit and I’m like, “Fuck, are you fucking serious?”
But his mom just fucking died, so I say, “Okay, dude. I’ll do it.”
So I’m… I’m… I’m killing some time before I get the address for the drop.
And I’ll admit it, I’m feeling pretty fucking cool,
but also it’s scary and shit,
and my heart’s, like, fucking pounding out of my chest.
So I duck into this bar. It’s, like, this hotel bar,
and I’m… I’m… I’m kind of feeling myself ’cause,
like, I’m on some real shit, and it’s, like, people are noticing.
Like, girls are fucking noticing, like,
I’ve got the fucking juice all of a sudden.
And it’s, like… I didn’t even, like, take a shower this morning, you know?
Like… Like I was trying to say before.
And it’s, like, three fucking girls, they just start talking to me, like, hot girls.
Like, I’ve got the fucking juice.
They’re buying me drinks and shit ’cause I’m broke.
[stammers] And then, I’m coming out of the bathroom,
and this older lady, she’s fucking hot too,
is straight up like, “Do you wanna come up to my room?”
And I’m like, “Yes, yes, yes. Of course.” This is my life. Why not live it?
And it’s, like, Diego’s mom just fucking died,
so I’m thinking about my life,
and I’m thinking about how it could just all go away at any time.
And so, we’re partying and I fucking… I fucking…
I just wanted to see what it was like, you know?
It’s like there was magic in there wrapped up in plastic,
like, it was radiating out, and I just wanted to try it.
Just the tiniest amount ’cause it’s, like…
Today was, like, the first day that I ever felt cool.
[sighs] Not that you guys would understand.
You’re, like, the coolest guys I’ve ever seen.
But I was so careful. Like, I was so careful.
You would never know that I tried it, but I did.
I did try it, and it didn’t make me feel cool.
It just… I just… I just… I just, like… [imitates explosion]
[sighs]
[sighs]
Is that it?
I think so, yeah.
Okay, then.
What’s the address for the drop?
[sighs] I don’t know.
Where’s your phone?
Uh, I hid it.
In the hotel?
No, before I left.
Why?
In case something happened. I hid my wallet too, in case I got picked up.
How were you gonna get the address of the drop if you don’t have your phone?
The pager.
Pager?
Where’s your pager?
I don’t have a pager. [chuckles] What’s this, like, the ’90s?
Who has the pager?
No one.
No one has the pager?
No.
Where is it?
Diego left it for me at his work.
Where?
It’s called Club Ice.
Used to be, uh, the something, uh, Palazzo. Uh, I don’t know.
He bartends there sometimes.
This guy, Diego, why would he trust you?
I guess ’cause we’re friends.
Do you guys… You don’t think it’s too late?
Early, late. You took the job, you gave your word.
You’re gonna finish it.
Right.
[rat squealing]
Are you guys seeing that?
How long have you both worked together for?
A long time.
I stopped counting.
[chuckles] Really? Mmm.
Well, yeah, you can tell.
[chuckles]
Is that so?
[kid] Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you got, like, basically the same clothes,
kinda talk the same, you know.
You’re, like, basically the same guy.
Hey, everything’s gonna be okay, right, after I make the drop?
‘Cause I just… I have a really big exam next week.
I really don’t wanna screw that up.
You won’t have to worry about that.
[people chattering]
I’ll be two seconds.
You’re hilarious.
What? No, no. I wo… I won’t run.
Well, in that case…
No, seriously. I can just go in.
I’ll get the pager. It’ll be fine.
All right? I promise. I’m not gonna… What?
[person singing in Croatian]
[singing continues]
[chattering continues]
Is that…
Croatian.
Why you both looking at each other like that?
You did that thing down in Gowanus, didn’t you?
No. Why would you say that?
I wondered why he didn’t call me. And when I heard
what a shit show that was…
No, that wasn’t a shit show.
So you did do Gowanus?
What is happening?
Not sure what happened to the body though.
You know that explosion at the evidence warehouse in the Bronx?
You’re kidding. That was you?
Yeah.
That was in October.
You were recovering at June’s.
Yeah.
Shit. She tried to warn me tonight.
She said there were people out there who, if they saw us t…
We need to get the pager. Why can’t we just go in and get the pager?
Because we can’t.
Why not?
Is it ’cause of the drugs? In case they’re searching people?
‘Cause one of you guys could just wait in here with the drugs.
I’m not leaving him with all the drugs.
I’m not leaving him.
You don’t trust your own partner?
[sighs]
Where is it?
What?
The pager.
It’s at the…
No. I’m not telling.
No fucking around, kid.
Where is the pager?
Tell me what’s going on.
No. Where’s the pager?
[kid] Why can’t you tell me?
We can’t.
Why not?
[Margaret’s man] Because we can’t.
Why?
Because we…
‘Cause we’re not partners.
[groans]
What?
There is an expectation of discretion in our line of work.
A kind of monasticism.
At least the way I learned it.
Same.
When you hire someone to do what we do,
you want someone who works alone.
No connections. No conflicting loyalties.
It’s the only way you can be trusted, is to trust no one.
But in that building back there is a very scary,
very violent man who, it turns out, we have both worked for in the past.
And if he saw us together…
[sighs] If he even suspected
I knew what he knew…
And I knew what he knew.
Then he would, without hesitation, have us killed immediately.
Or he’d kill us himself.
[sighs]
So you’re secret partners?
We’re not secret partners.
We’re not partners. Jesus Christ.
All right. Here’s what gonna happen.
We keep the drugs with us.
And we all go in.
No one leaves anyone’s sight.
And you get that goddamn pager.
I’m going to pray to Christ that Dimitri doesn’t see you and me together.
Dumbest, most dangerous plan.
Are you really not partners?
[kid] The ladder’s really cold.
[Pam’s man] What?
The ladder’s really cold.
[Pam’s man] Shut up.
[wedding guests chattering, laughing]
[“Mr. Vain” playing]
[music continues]
Um, I’m friends with Diego, and he left something for me.
What?
He left a pager.
Diego, he left a pager for me. It’s a green pager.
Got you, man.
Okay. Thank you.
No, no, no. No, no, no. It’s a pager. It’s right there.
Can you…
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing behind the bar?
What are you doing behind the bar?
I wasn’t doing anything.
I was just talking to that guy over there. No.
[groaning]
[kid] Okay, okay.

No, boys, no! Everyone, calm down!

What’s going on here, Dimitri?
Who the fuck is this asshole?
Who the fuck are you?
[Dimitri] Boys, boys, it’s fine.
[speaks Croatian]
Everyone, calm down. Give me those.
Guns are only for the wedding party.
[wedding guests chuckle]
[in Croatian] I’m sorry, baby. Please, I’m sorry…
…I’ll fix it.
[in English] Everyone, it’s okay.
They are friends.
Yeah.
Come here, both of you.
Come here.
Start the music, please.
[“One More Night” playing]
[wedding guests murmuring]
[shushes] Hey.
[whistles]
[grunts]
You crash my daughter’s wedding and then you pull out guns, huh?
I came to pay my respects.
Wait, Dimitri, you know this asshole?
[chuckles] Believe it or not, you two offer not dissimilar services.
With all due respect, Dimitri, I highly doubt that.
And if I ever see you again, bucko…
[grunts]
[grunts]
Oof.
[grunting, groaning]
[guest] Hey!
Let’s go!
Oof.
All right, all right, all right.
[wedding guests gasping, clamoring]
Hey, leave him. Stay. Have a drink.
I got a job to do.
Oh, I see.
The professional.
The lone wolf. Mmm.
[Dimitri chuckles]
Sorry for the disturbance.
Congratulations on your daughter’s wedding.
Sweetie.
Hey, sweetie.
Come here. Hey.

I told you I wasn’t gonna run.
There’s no address yet.
We still got some time.
[sighs]
I wanna finish the job too.
Come on.
[sirens wailing]
[kid chewing]
Would you shut your mouth when you chew?
[shushes]
[kid] Okay.
Hey, how do you even start doing something like this?
Like what-what… you know, what you guys do.
What is it you think we do?
Well, you fix things, right?
Like, if something’s messed up or, like, if someone, like,
messes up, you, like, make it okay, right?
More or less.
Hmm. Well, um, thank you.
[breathes deeply]
[slurps, swallows]
Mmm.
Too bad you both can’t work together.
Like, what you do must be really lonely.
I’m gonna pee.
So, Lagrange has a mole with Dimitri, or Diego is playing both sides somehow.
You still on this conspiracy thing?
Diego’s dead mom was a bullshit story.
They’re setting the kid up. But why? And how did Lagrange get that shipment?
What does it matter?
You’re not curious?
Doesn’t change the job.
So you’re not curious?
Would be a valuable piece of intel.
We’d have to figure out how to play it. We both can’t know everything.
Okay. Then one of us would make the drop.
Then maybe we figure out what the fuck’s going on.
If we get the address.
If we get the address, one of us makes the drop.
No.
He has to do it.
What? You… No, no, no.
He could run. He could talk. There’s too many variables with that kid.
He has to do it.
I’m not following.
Sometimes the job takes care of itself.
Oh.
So the kid walks in and he gets shot?
Because you don’t wanna do it?
I don’t do anything I don’t have to. Especially not that.
Or you’ve lost your nerve.
Mmm. I mean, this kid doesn’t come home, people are gonna look for him.
This way, they find him.
No, no. I get it.
You could just let him live.
Hmm.
Let’s say you’re wrong.
The kid makes the drop, and he walks out alive.
Then…
You know why they have multiple shooters on a firing squad?
I do.
So…
I’m not asking. I don’t need your help.
I know y…
I’m… I’m offering.
Why? So you can say I lost my edge?
To who?

I’m saying that I unders…
I know what… what that feels… doing that.
So maybe this way it would…

yeah.

Hmm.

Was nice to meet you guys.
You never met us.

Um, hey, Dad. These guys need to talk to you about something.
[kid’s dad] So, Frank is doing this movie, Manchurian Candidate.
He’s notorious for just doing one take.
And the director, he says, “That was perfect. Let’s do one more.”
Frank says, “I’ll tell you what,
if it’s so perfect, why don’t you print it twice?”
You like it black?
Black’s fine.

[Pam’s man] That was a very intimidating performance in there, by the way.
[Margaret’s man] You like that thing with the pliers?
[Pam’s man] Might even steal it.
[Margaret’s man] You like blini?
[Pam’s man] Love a blini.
[Margaret’s man speaks indistinctly]
[Pam’s man] Yeah.
[server] There we go. Thank you.
[chuckles]
A tracker.
In the goddamn drugs.
Should’ve caught that immediately.
So, did Lagrange even steal the drugs, or were… [stammers]
I… [scoffs]
Oh, so now you don’t care who stole the shipment?
I don’t think it matters as long as the kid stays quiet.
[chuckles]
You do realize one of us, most likely, eventually…
Yeah. Probably. Cross that bridge…
If he can be killed. [chuckles]
Yeah. Well…
[Pam’s man] Lucky fucker.
Well, that was a night.
Yeah. [sighs]
Yeah.
All right, then.
[grunts] So, what did she say to you to get you to work with me?
What’d she say? She had all the leverage.
She said that I didn’t have a choice.
All right.
“You take a job, you give your word, and that word’s the measure of the man.”
Who called you?
[Pam’s man] What?
In the car to June’s.
Who called you?
Who called you?
It was your guy.
My guy?
The guy that Pam got your number from. Your guy.
So, she must have called him.
But then why call me?
Who called…
You’re saying the DA got your number…
No.
Yeah.
We have the same guy?
We both have the same guy.
But why does he care? It’s just a cleanup job.
He doesn’t. Unless…
Unless he knew about the drugs.
Kid’s dead, can’t make the drop, so he calls us.
One at a time, but nobody answers.
So, he sent someone else.
Chinatown.
Sees the kid’s alive.
Hard to miss. The plan’s back on track.
Except,
we’re on our way to Dimitri’s…
Who would have killed us, except…
We didn’t fool Dimitri. He was tipped off.
Bodyguard didn’t get the memo.
The Albanians don’t make a move because…
The tracker’s not even on.
Until the page.
It was all a setup.
It looks like Lagrange
is trying to move the stolen drugs.
And the Albanians go to war with Lagrange,
no competition.
The city shuts down.
People get arrested.
I know a DA who’s tough on crime.
…the real thief to clean up.
…who can clean drug money.
Great things to come.
No wonder they wanted the cameras in the room.
He wanted to know who knew.
But the kid turns the ambush into a shoot-out.
We were supposed to take the fall. He didn’t think we’d send the kid in.
[both] We were getting cleaned.

He’s not gonna let us out of here alive.
Nope.

[wind blowing]
[dramatic music playing]
[Bali] There’s that old Greek myth about the guy who flew too high.
Icarus was his name, and he had a pair of homemade wings.
And he thought he could just keep going up forever, higher than anyone, higher than the gods.
And he knew what would happen if he got too close to the sun.
But he did it anyway.
[dramatic music swells, stops abruptly]
[mysterious music playing]
[camera clicking]
[church bell tolling]
[women singing somber song in Greek]
The Icarus myth was set on the island of Crete.
And apparently, nobody there had learned much from his story.
Of course, neither had I.
Not yet.
That’s the thing about myths.
Easy to ignore.
The family of the fallen guy were rich… really rich.
They were in shipping.
They ran the island through violence and extortion.
And they were only half Greek.




That’s hubris for you.
Fatal flaw of the gods and all the rest of us.
[woman] Welcome, Mr. Bali.
[Bali] Thanks so much.
[woman] Here you go. Enjoy your stay.
All right, have a good one.
[speaking Greek] I hope you find what you’re looking for.
I hope so, too. Thank you.
You’re welcome.
[Bali] She sent a message with the plane ticket.
Said to look for the vintage brown Benz.
She didn’t mention the white pants.
Mrs. Vardakis.
You can call me Penelope.
Okay.
I appreciate you coming, Mr. Bali.
Nick is fine.
Sally Burnham is a friend of mine.
She told me that you helped her with a little problem in Athens.
Sorry, could I ask you a favor? You mind taking off your sunglasses?
Excuse me?
I don’t mean to be rude.
I just like to look people in the eye when I talk to them.
I have a problem of my own, and I can’t trust the local police.
Why is that?




My husband’s family owns them.
Vardakises are like gods here.
And in Crete, no one goes against the gods.
Uh-huh.
We buried my brother-in-law two days ago.
He died climbing on the island.
I read about him. Sorry for your loss.
What a terrible accident.
Murder.
No one will investigate.
It’s not a narrative that works for my husband’s family.
They run Eurytus, the shipping company.
Right, I know it.
Yeah. Anything other than an accident could cause turbulence to the stock,
and they won’t have that.
I need a private investigator to sort this out for me.
I have money.
My question to you is: why?
Your husband’s a powerful man.
This might make trouble for him, for his family, your family.
I knew Leo before I ever met my husband.
He was a good person.
A friend of mine.
And if I don’t do this, no one else will.
I’ll double your rate.




Well, thank you.
This has to stay between us.
No one can know that you’re working for me.
Of course.
I’ve arranged your accommodation.
You can follow me.
[car door closes]
[Bali] I’d been doing P.I. work in Athens, following cheating husbands and wives,
but this felt different.
She made me feel less like an investigator and more like her accomplice.

His injuries are consistent with a fall from a height of 30 meters.
Multiple skull fractures, major brain trauma.
And, uh, what’s this? On his fingers?
Climbing chalk.
Uh-huh.
And, um, why the broken fingers?
It’s common with rock climbers. Lot of pressure on the hands.
He must have been trying to hang on.
So this is, uh, an equipment failure?
No. There was no equipment.
He climbed free solo, no ropes.
Isn’t that kind of risky?
Evidently.
Are we done here?
Yeah, one more thing.
You got the name of the investigating officer?
It’s, uh, Georges Mensah.
Thanks a lot.
[Bali] Sometimes you use a carrot.
Sometimes you use a stick.
Sometimes you just lie your ass off.
[knocks]
Detective Mensah?
Who let you back here?
Sorry to disturb.
I’m from Eastern Global Life Insurance.
I’m, uh, head of investigations with our American office.




Leo Vardakis had a policy with us.
[laughs] Look at this guy.
I had a dog just like this when I was a kid. Hey, baby.
Oh, hello.
[Mensah] Uh, if you don’t mind, I’m busy, so…
[grunting playfully]
Uh, yeah, this is just a formality as far as I’m concerned.
Some rich guy fell off a rock ’cause he was too vain to use a rope,
but I do need some details.
You could’ve picked up the phone.
Would’ve saved you a lot of trouble to come all this way,
find out the case is closed.
I’m not sure you realize how much money is involved here.
It’s a very high-value account, so the company doesn’t part ways
with that kind of cash without sending somebody in person,
for due diligence.
Good-looking family. Quite a funeral?
I don’t know what you’re hoping to find.
The official report recorded it as an accidental death.
Any witnesses?
No.
What was the time of death?
It’s in the report.
Great. Could I see that?
No.
It’s bad luck though to just fall without anybody else around, don’t you think?
Doesn’t matter what I think.
When did forensics make their determination of cause of death?
A day after he died last week.
Two days ago, you showed up to his funeral with a camera.
It looks like they were all there.

The widowed matriarch, Audrey Vardakis.
Leo’s twin brother, Elias.
The CEO with his perfect wife.
A clan worthy of Tolstoy, right?
Each unhappy in their own way.
But who was unhappy with Leo?
You must have some idea.
If I could just get a half hour with this stuff before it’s archived.
Any chance you could help me out, my friend?
Is that supposed to be Greek?
I am Greek.
My dog is more Greek than you are.
Look, all I need is just a quick look…
Stop.
Bribery is punishable by imprisonment under Greek law,
so if the next thing that comes out of your pocket is money…
I’ll be in town a few days.
Anything changes with the case, let me know.




Case is closed.
You said that already.

His brother had just died climbing free solo,

Just like Icarus.
Some guys need to feel like they’re above everyone.
Lot of climbers out today.
There’s usually more. It’s too hot.

You climb?
Nah, it’s not my thing.

My accent’s not the best, but I get by.
There’s a couple of us in the organization.
They bring us into situations like this
where your company’s taken heavy investment from my side of the pond.
Well, of course.
Can I see some I.D.?
Absolutely.
And you know, it’s good you ask.
Not everybody does.
I’m trying to be discreet, out of respect, but, uh, if you want,
I could go now and then bring back a couple more agents.
We could, uh, search your house, your car…
My mother’s not to be disturbed.
All right, so let me buy you a coffee.
[Bali over device] Are you sure you, uh… you don’t want anything? Coffee?
[mysterious music playing]
What can you tell me about what happened to your brother?
I was told the police had closed their investigation.
Yeah, they have. It’s just, your family’s profile being what it is,
it’s important that we come in and dot the I’s, cross the T’s.
Remove any suspicion there’s been criminal activity.
Is that what you think happened?
If you don’t mind, could we start with, uh, the morning of your brother’s death?
Where were you?
At home in bed.
My wife come in, woke me, told me Leo’s body had been found.
Mm-hmm. And, uh, what time was that?
8:30-ish. She’s usually up for a swim by 7:00, has her breakfast by the pool.
When’s the last time you saw your brother alive?
It was three weeks before he died.
Three weeks? Since you’d seen your brother?
Is that so strange?
When’d you last see your brother?
I don’t have one.
Well, your family then, your mother, father, wife.
It’s an island.
I just figured you’d run into each other.
You’ll hear this anyway, so I’ll tell you myself.
The last time Leo and I were together, we had a fight.
Okay. Uh, what was it about?
Don’t remember.
We were drunk.
My father pit us against each other from an early age,
gave us boxing gloves when we were four.
It stuck as a habit.
So you two, uh, you didn’t get along?
We were monozygotic twins, Mr. Bali.
You don’t get closer than that.
I loved my brother.
I just wish I’d been there for him.
Well, this must be a very hard time for you, your family, your wife.
Uh, was she very close with your brother?
Not really.

My apologies.
I have a business matter I need to attend to.
The life of a CEO of a multinational like Eurytus.
Listen, I’ll get the coffee.
You’ve been very generous with your time.
If you think of anything else
or if, um, perhaps your mother would be willing to speak…
Look, I am happy to help you.
Leave my mother out of this.
She’s lost her husband and a son in the space of 18 months.
I don’t want anything else upsetting her.

Why don’t we listen back to it together?
We can compare notes.
Yeah, well, first you’re gonna have to let me know who you really are,
because one minute you’re from an insurance company and now you’re NIS.
I was a detective for the NYPD.
Now I’m doing P.I. work out of Athens.
Why Athens?
Because my uncle owns an apartment here.
It’s a piece-of-shit place, but rent’s cheap.
It’s somewhere to escape to.
What are you escaping from?
Family things.
Look.
I can imagine how the Vardakis family treats people on this island,
so I can also imagine why a good cop like you

[Elias] Well, your family then, your mother, father,
wife.
Smart. Turning it around on me. He’s good under pressure.
You think he’s hiding something?
Yeah.
He was fussing with his wedding ring right there,
and he scratched his chin.
If scratching was a sign of guilt, my dog would be doing 20 years to life.
[Bali over speaker] …your family, your wife.
Was she very close with your brother?
[Elias] Not really.
He hesitated there.
And he’s too emphatic, the way he shuts it down.
He’s jealous of something, of someone. I can feel it.
But he’s got everything a man could possibly want.
Money, power, a beautiful wife.
If anyone would’ve been jealous, it was Leo.
Yeah, that’s the part I’m stuck on. Something doesn’t fit.
Could you send me a copy of that audio file?
Yeah, all right.
Who’s this?
That’s Yannis Dimitriou.
Local fixer.
When high rollers come into town, he hooks them up with whatever they need.

Drugs, parties, women.
Him and Elias are good friends.
Sorry, uh… I got to go.
So you still think he’s just some rich guy who slipped off a rock?
You still think the case is closed?
Officially, sure.
Unofficially, I never did.
But, you know, let’s keep all this between us.
These walls have big ears.

Thank you.
I loved it.
You’re welcome, my child.
Did you speak with Elias?
Yeah.
You have to ask me before you talk to anyone in this family.
Was Elias jealous of his brother?
Why would he be jealous?
I don’t know. That’s what I’m trying to figure out.
But you knew Leo before you knew him, right?
Sure.
You want to tell me about that?
What do you want to know?
Tell me the whole story.
Um, all right, I met Leo Freshers’ week
at Oxford.
I didn’t come from money, so I had to work my ass off to get a scholarship.
Anything else?
Not unless you want to help me write a paper…
[Penelope] But even with a scholarship, I still had to get another job
just to offset bills.
Can I buy you a drink later?
[Penelope] I didn’t have any free time for friends or social life.
[Leo] I like a little pressure…
[Penelope] But that didn’t stop Leo from hanging around.
It was strange.
Yeah, I didn’t really know what to make of it at first.
You know, this rich kid who went to the best boarding schools
his entire life, and…
and him showing attention to me.
It was flattering, don’t get me wrong,
but, um, there was just always something that was very…
He was trying really hard, and it came across as desperate and needy…
Uh, when we first spoke, you said he was sweet and kind.
Now you’re saying he’s desperate and needy, so which is it?
Well, both things can be true.
Uh, okay.
And tell me how Elias enters the picture.
It’s late. I should go.
I’m just trying to understand what happened here, okay?
You brought me into this.
You ever do something you regret?
And… no matter how hard you try to make it right,

♪ ♪
[Bali] Good morning.
I’m not open yet.
[speaks Greek]
I don’t want a drink.
You sure about that?
I wanted to ask you about Leo Vardakis.
You’re his friend, right? You were at his funeral.
You’re V-Victoria Lekaki, right?
Yes.
Elias told me that he and Leo had a fight a couple weeks before he died, at a bar.
Was that this bar?
Um…
Are you a friend of Elias?
Well, I’ve, uh, talked to him a little bit,
but I’m actually not sure how I feel about him.
What do you want to know?
Who started the fight?
I didn’t hear it. We were busy.
You have no idea what it was about?
No.
Could it have, uh, been about money?
Leo didn’t need any money.
He had a salary from the family business.
Mostly for appearances.
Um, Audrey Vardakis cares very much about appearances.
She’s British, but she married into a Greek family,
so she’s always trying to act Greek.
Um, we have a word for this.
[speaks Greek]
It’s not a good word.
Yeah, sounds pretty bad.
So she didn’t trust him around the business?
He was more, um… a creative, uh, soul.
And for his family, they thought this made him weak.
But, um…
…Leo was strong.
He had endurance.
He could, um, stay the course, yeah?
They were wrong about him.
And about Elias.
Whoa. What about Elias?
[scoffs]
He’s a… he’s a bullshit man.
Leo hated how his brother treated people.
Especially his wife.
Did Leo love Penelope?
Mm-hmm.
How’d Elias feel about that?
How would I know?
And what about you?
Was that tough for you, Leo having feelings for her?
Sorry, I…
No judgment. I just, uh, know how it feels.
Leo was a friend.
But, um, I know my place.
He was the son of a billionaire, and I’m a, I’m a daughter of a bartender.
Penelope wasn’t from money.
Well, I’m not Penelope.
[chuckles]
None of us are.
You think she married the wrong man?
Her life would’ve been easier with Leo.
But I guess Elias won that match.
Um, because that’s always what happens.
Elias has to win.
But even if it means killing his own brother?
[chuckles]
I may not like him, but I-I don’t think he’s capable of that.
If-if Leo threatened Elias…
You said yourself Leo didn’t like how Elias treated people,
so if he had a story, something really juicy,
and he was threatening to go public,
like, that could be damaging to the CEO of a billion-dollar company,
impact the stock price…
I-I don’t know.
I mean, Elias runs the company, but Audrey runs the family.
You understand?
Uh-huh.
But… but, um, who am I…
No, no, no, keep going. What do you mean, Audrey runs…
Sorry, sorry.
I mean, you don’t stand against this family.
Not someone like me.
I-I just pour the drinks.
[opens bottle]

Leo has been climbing that rock since he was a boy.
Soon as I heard about the accident, I knew something didn’t fit.
I hope you find whoever killed him.

Oh, what’s happening?
There’s a benefit tonight to reelect the governor.

♪ ♪
This is where they found his boat.
Oh. It’s always this quiet?
Yeah, you can only get here by water.
Which is why Leo liked to climb.
It’s very remote, peaceful.
Perfect place to kill somebody.
Sorry.
[Penelope] This is where they found his body.
[Bali] Right here?
Yeah.
[Bali] Geez.
I spoke to someone at the morgue.
They said he fell 30 meters.
There’s a path up. I could show you.
Okay.
[both chuckle]
Ah, so he climbed that with no rope?
Yeah.
Yeah, both brothers grew up climbing free solo.
Their dad was adamant that it would prepare them for a life in business.
Audrey pushed in a different way.
It was psychological with her, and Leo really took the brunt of that.
I, uh, talked to Victoria Lekaki.
She also thinks Leo was murdered.
Probably the first thing she and I have ever agreed on.
Oh, you don’t like her?
She thinks I broke Leo’s heart.
Uh-huh. And did you?
[Penelope] I knew Leo had a twin, but I’d never met him before.
What’s her name, then?
Penelope.
You fucked her yet?
[chuckles]
[Penelope] Elias had been working with their father,
so he started a semester late.
[phone beeping] I got a message one night
asking if we could study together.
I was falling behind with all the shifts I was doing,
so I was actually really grateful that he’d asked.
[low, upbeat music playing]
Cheers.
[glasses clink]
Hey.
You didn’t bring your books?
We don’t need them.
[Penelope] It was him, but…
What are you doing?
…he was different.
He had this confidence to him that Leo never had.
It was like he was just completely present.
I’ll go if you ask me to.
[both breathing heavily]
[Penelope moaning]
[heavy breathing slows]
And you really had no idea that it was Elias, not Leo that night?
I knew.
Elias and I started seeing each other.
I met his parents, and it was obvious he was Audrey’s favorite.
She was so protective of him.
I just had no idea how much Leo was excluded from the family.
Or how deep the rivalry was with his brother.
That must have been, uh, very painful for Leo.
Being in love with you.
Watching you fall for him.
Yeah.
Elias and Leo got in a fight the last time they saw each other before Leo died.
Did Leo know something about your husband that got him killed?
Killed by who?
By someone with a vested interest in keeping Elias in power.
I want to talk to Audrey.
That’s not gonna happen.
If Leo was threatening Elias, threatening the company, threatening the family,
Audrey would know.
Yeah, but even if she did, she wouldn’t say anything to you.
That’s why I want to see her face when I bring it up.
Well, you’re not gonna get anywhere near her.
[sighs]
She has security, and ever since Elias’s dad died,
he’s been very protective of her.
Yeah.
Okay, what about, uh… the… thing tonight?
The benefit?
It’s an exclusive event, and it’s on the yacht.
It’s an exclusive… What are you, uh, protecting her?
No. God, no.
Then get me on the list.
I can’t. You don’t understand.
I am trying to help you. Do you want answers or not?
I know, but if Elias ever found out that I was the one who arranged this…
He’s not gonna know that. No one’ll know that.
Fine. Uh, okay. Uh, all right.
Okay.
Okay. [sighs]
You can’t go looking like that, though.
I’ll have something sent over.
Wait, wait. Looking like what?

And guess what color the pants were.
Welcome, sir. Enjoy the party.

[Elias over speaker] I’ll keep this brief.
I just want to thank you all for joining us this evening
to support the reelection of our governor, Kostas Gerontas.
Kostas… [speaks Greek]
[applause]
This island has always been a haven for our family,
and never more so than this past week,
which has been the hardest that we’ve known.
Governor Gerontas and the entire police department
have made my family feel protected and safe,
which, when you lose someone, is what matters most.
Thank you, my friend.
With your help, we can give this good man another term in office to protect us all.

Thank you for all of your support.

My family always used to vacation here. They still do, actually.
So there were a whole bunch of us that used to hang out.
Victoria, you know.
Yes, of course.
I’m so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Vardakis.
Mm.
Thank you.
Leo was a kind soul.
So creative.
He was a dreamer.
[laughs] Yeah.
Yeah, he was.
And Elias is holding up okay considering what happened.
The strange way that Leo died.
I can’t believe this thing they’re saying about it being an accident, do you?
I mean, Leo was a good climber. He wouldn’t just fall.
I’m used to people coming after me and my family.
So let’s cut the shit, Nick.
Why did you buy a new suit and come here tonight?
What do you want?
Trying to understand what really happened to my friend.
Get away from her!
[people gasp]
I told you to leave her alone.
[Audrey] You know this man?
He said he was NIS looking into Leo’s death.
He’s a fucking liar. He’s a P.I.
Who hired you? Victoria?
I’m afraid that’s between me and my client.
[Elias] My brother’s death was an accident.
I don’t think so.
Is that what you’re trying to prove
bribing your way into the morgue?
Hanging around the police station? It’s pathetic.
This man gets no more cooperation from now on. Do you understand?
Now get the fuck off my boat before I throw you off.
Oh. Was that a confession?
Now go back to Athens.
Better yet, go back to New York.

Thank you for not blowing my cover on the yacht.
What happened?
Ah. [scoffs]
I like to look people in the eye when I speak to them.
Who did this?
I followed Elias into Kíthira last night and saw him give Yannis some cash.
They spotted me. I should’ve been more careful.
Elias did this?
Yannis, technically.
Nick, they could’ve killed you.
Yeah, and if he finds out that you hired me,
what do you think he’s gonna do to you?
I’m not afraid.
Maybe you should be.
Come on.
These ruins date back to the seventh century B.C.
This city was named after this goddess Leto.
Story goes that Zeus fell in love with her.
But he already had a wife, Hera.
[Bali] She told me the myth behind these ruins.
About the gods of this island and their jealousies.
[Penelope] The lesson is do not betray the gods.
But Elias is not a god.
On this island, he is.
People like Yannis, they do anything he tells them to.
He’s the first person Elias calls when we land here.
Gets him anything he wants.
I heard about that.
Drugs, parties.
Women.
You can say it. You don’t have to be coy.
I know my husband fucks other women.
It’s been going on for years.
Started right after we got married.
I called him out about it early on, but somehow it was always my fault.
Like I was the one who drove him to do it.
Why didn’t you just walk away?
People do.
If it was that easy, don’t you think I would?
I’ve tried.
He doesn’t listen to me.
I tell him I need to leave. He tells me I can’t.
He goes on and on about being in love with me.
How if I ever did leave, he’d kill himself or kill me.
And he promises he’ll change.
You know, that he’ll do anything.
The fucked-up thing is that he actually does change.
Just long enough to make me believe.
I know that that sounds weak.
It is weak.
I’ve just never been strong enough.
That why you had an affair with Leo?
You left a hair tie in his apartment.
It was the same one you were using when you were swimming at the villa.
You lied to me.
I went to that party thinking it was blackmail,
thinking the whole gigantic family business was at stake
and that Audrey was involved.
I asked you, “Is there any reason Elias would be jealous of Leo?”
You said no.
I never said no.
Fine, but the whole time, you were covering up an affair.
Why didn’t you tell me?
I couldn’t risk that.
I didn’t trust you yet.
You saying you trust me now?
Maybe.
Can you trust me?
I don’t know. You cheated on your husband.
Elias doesn’t know about Leo.
I think he does.
I could tell that guy was jealous of something.
Now I know what. The guy’s brother slept with his wife.
He killed him for it. Talk about an old story.
Now I just need to prove it.
Beach where Leo died, could a person swim those waters?
Uh, it’s about two miles of rocky coast in either direction
and the currents are very strong.
So maybe a boat?
‘Cause you said the cliff’s inaccessible by land,
so whoever killed Leo had to get to the beach
and then leave the beach again by sea.
And if they can’t swim it, maybe there’s a boat waiting.
The first time we were there, I noticed some fishermen offshore.
Maybe someone saw something.
[Penelope] And if they did, you really think they’re gonna say anything to you?
[Bali chuckles]
Don’t betray the gods, right?
This is what I’m saying.
Elias owns everyone on this island.
Well, maybe not everyone.

And, uh, Yannis might have arranged that boat, but he was never on it.
That was you.
[sniffles]
Yeah.
And then once he came back, he just changed the plan.
[Bali] Got it. ‘Cause you were supposed to walk away,
and then he wouldn’t let you.
Mm-hmm.
Just like his brother.
I mean, it was different.
Um…
With Elias,
it was complicated, but it was love.
It was real love.
And with Leo, it was just scary.
[tense music playing]
He told me that, uh…
[breathes heavily]
He told me that he’d lost me once and he wasn’t gonna lose me again.
[sniffles]
And that eventually I would learn to love him.
That he’d be a better husband to me than his brother was.
So that’s why you needed me.
To expose him.
And once you had me on the hook, you made it easy.
[mysterious music playing]
Not too easy. [chuckles, sniffles]
[scoffs] Pretty easy.
[laughs]
[groans]
[sniffles]
Why didn’t you just tell Audrey?
I couldn’t tell Audrey.
She wouldn’t believe me. [sniffles]
I mean, even if she had, Leo would have found a way to spin it and pin it on me.
I needed someone else to find out the truth. [sniffles]
I knew that once Audrey found out, she would do something.
I just didn’t… I mean, I didn’t know that she would…
Nick. Nick!
What now?
Nothing.
You saved yourself.
I’m not gonna hold that against you.
The man you loved didn’t give you the life you deserved.
You said you wanted out.
He just should’ve let you leave.
Did you let your wife leave?
I wanted to kill her. [chuckles]
And the guy she’d been seeing.
I almost did, too. I could feel it…
…coming up in me.
But you didn’t.
[tense music playing]
[sobbing]
[dramatic music playing]
You saved yourself, too.
You didn’t hurt anybody. [chuckles]
Your daughter gets to grow up with a mother and a father.
I’m no good to her.
Not in Athens.
You’re a much better man than you realize, Nick.

[indistinct announcements over P.A.]

[chuckles softly]
What did you whisper to him?
[whispers] Now I’m free.
[Bali] Freedom.
That’s what Icarus wanted.
And he ended up dying for it.
It’s what Penelope wanted, and…
she was willing to kill for it.

I like to think of myself as free.
But I’m not sure that’s right.
I’m as caught up as anyone.

I think about everything that happened that day.

Even if I don’t want to think about it, it pops up.
I kind of dive into the thoughts sometimes by mistake.
At the beginning, I thought maybe to tell my friends to… to leave.
But at that point, it was already too late.
They’re shooting at us, and they’re going to try to kidnap us or kill us.
Everyone was trying to call some authority.
And no one was really answering.
I remember at one point that there was a really big explosion, and I flew back.
Someone flew on me.
And when I finally got up, I realized that I was sitting in a pile of bodies.
[people screaming]
Car after car of dead people.
Then you start realizing what happened.




We survived a horrific terror attack that didn’t seem possible to survive.
I’ve kind of understood that I’m never going to be the person that I was before the 7th of October.
And I’m trying to figure out who I’m going to be now.

The festival itself was amazing.
The festival itself was amazing.
I’ve not seen anything even remotely close to that in Israel in years.
Everything was perfect.
The energy of people just wanting to dance and enjoy themselves and then going at it with all that they have, it was beautiful.
There’s something about seeing a trance dance floor move.
You feel connected.
You feel part of something.
You’re accepted no matter who you are and what you’re bringing.

3,500 people went to a festival to dance in the nature for peace and for love.
400 of them didn’t come home.
And they’re not going to.
♪
In these kind of raves, you don’t really know where it is.
And you get a location the night of the party.
I remember driving and just looking out the window and seeing Gaza.
And I didn’t even think it was dangerous.
We were all students starting our fourth year.




We all like going to parties.
And the second Nova tickets came out, they were really cheap.
Seemed like a perfect thing to do right before the year started.

When I got there and I understood that I can see the fence dividing us from Gaza from where we are,
it was like, well, it’s been quiet for a while.
There haven’t been any missiles.
It will probably be OK.

So my name is Noa.
I’m 29 years old.
I work as a booking agent for electronic music.

I came to the Nova party for work.
I brought a DJ from Hungary.
My job was to take him to the party, let him play his set, and then take him back home.
This production was in collaboration with the Universo Paralello.
It’s a very big festival in Brazil.
They were in Israel.
It looked like we were at a concert somewhere in Europe.
It was… it was beautiful.
I’ve met people and DJs from all over the world.
There are Jews and Arabs and tourists that come in.
You see people from every edge of religion.




It’s not something that we notice.
It’s not something that we care about.
Be a human being.
Be happy, smile, dance with people, and you’ll probably be fine in the end.
Whoo-hoo!
Hey!
There’s something about the moment that the sun rises that you suddenly see the people around you, that you suddenly see the smiles and that the energy comes together.
You can actually see the dance floor moving into a place.
I was on the stage. So I could actually see it.
I looked at the person next to me, and we were both like, wow.

This is a test of frequency instruments.
Bass, drums, distortion, artifacts.

And I see a bunch of people looking up to the sky.
OK, probably just like seeing the sun rise or something?

It was the last drop that he played.

The moment that I stopped filming, someone grabbed my hand and showed me the sky.

He yelled into the crowd, Tzeva Adom, Tzeva Adom.
Everyone scattered.




[explosions]
It was like a screen coming up from the sky of rockets, just like whew.
The most rockets I’ve ever seen in my life.
Oh, fuck!
We laid on the ground.
I was honestly scared.
You’re in an open field.
There’s rockets everywhere.
Nothing is stopping these rockets from falling
exactly where I am right now.
Whoa!
[laughs]
Whoo.
[explosions]
Whoa.
[chatter]
We were parked in the artists’ VIP area.
The big parking was a little bit more in.
So we were very close to the road.
We could get out very quickly.
I went to the DJ, and I told him, listen, there’s no time for goodbyes.
There’s no time for waiting.
We’re running to the car.
We’re going to leave.
And we were driving on Route 232.
On the way north, we passed Be’eri.
I’d close the windows and put on music so that we don’t hear what’s going on outside, and we were driving.

Rockets were exploding over our heads.
We didn’t understand if we’re safe or we’re not safe.
We stop at the side of the road.
We see the migunit, concrete structure on the side of the road that is supposed to be as close to a bomb shelter as possible.
And it seemed like the smartest move to make, to go into the migunit.

When we got to about 200 meters before the first thing, we took the turn.
The two cars that were in front of me suddenly hit the brakes.
At first, it looked like an accident.
So my first instinct was, you need to get out and help someone.
So I opened my door.
And the moment I opened my door, I heard the first bullet.
[gunshot]
♪
At this point, no one knows that there’s terrorists that entered Israel.
I think there was about 19 people in migunit.
It’s a tiny structure.
There’s not that much room to move inside.
Some of the people are still standing outside just to look at the rockets.
And then slowly, more and more people come.
Finally, four people arrived.
One of them was Aner Shapiro.
And one of them was Hersh Goldberg.
Aner was very confident.
I remember it. He walked in.
He told us that there’s a big attack on Israel from Gaza.
He didn’t really elaborate too much.
My… my heart jumped a beat.
And I realized that something bad is about to happen.
I felt it so deep in my stomach that I didn’t even know what to do or how to react.
At the beginning, I thought maybe to tell my friends to leave so they get in the car and drive away.

The only thing between me and the terrorists were my car doors.
There were a few moments where I thought I was dead.
The only reason that they missed is by chance.
Something was protecting us.
I don’t have a word for it.
But I thought I was dead.
I was either dead, or I was very, very hurt and I wasn’t feeling it.
If I’m not feeling any pain, then I’m probably dead.
That was the math I did in my head.
I looked at my hands and understood that I was still alive and that we need to do something.
And then I just yelled, “Get in the car.”
[car horn honking
I looked in the back mirror, and I could see the car behind me that had stopped.
The driver and the guy that were next to him were shot in the head.
[gunfire, screaming]
And I saw them slaughter people.
Every car that had come towards us had either been show off the road… and you could actually see cars just going off the road in a moment.
And then people tried to run out of the cars, and there were terrorists shooting them down.

Tuck your heads down. Tuck your heads down.

A group of people jump out, screaming in Arabic.

Aner tried to calm everyone down as much as possible.
And then they started firing at the entrance of the migunit.
[gunfire]
Lobed, he went outside and tried to talk to them in Arabic.
They did horrible things to him and murdered him in the end.
Everyone in the migunit was trying to call some authority, MDA or the cops or the army or someone.
No one was really answering.
And then I see Aner just picked them up and tossed them out.
[explosion]
And he does that once, and then they throw another one in.
Every time they throw in a grenade, he just grabbed it and tossed it out.

He acted like a commander.
He took all the responsibility onto himself.
He was focused.
He… he understood that he had a mission.
All he was looking for was to fight, to stay alive.

I’m thinking to myself, oh, my God, this kid is throwing live grenades.
I don’t think that I’ve ever heard of anyone ever doing that.
I know how dangerous this is.
I think there’s a chance that he’s not the only one that’s going to have to do this.
And I kind of get myself ready for the point where if something happens to him, that I’m going to have to pick up what he left.

There was a really big explosion, and I flew back.
Someone flew on me.
And when I finally got up, I remember Aner wasn’t standing anymore.
He wasn’t with us.
Hersh lost his hand.
And he was just sitting there.
He said, “I lost my hand.
I don’t have my hand.”
And he was trying to, like, tie it off.
At that point, I kind of realized that someone’s going to have to continue what he started.
And then I remember a grenade flying in, just landing right in front of me.
And you could see the flame coming out of the top of the grenade.
And it was a few inches.
And I remember it getting smaller and smaller.

He was wearing all black.
He had a black mask on, an AK-47,
and a green bandanna on his head with the Hamas symbol.
I remember you could see his mouth through the mask,

Original title: El hoyo 2

Genre: Sci-Fi, Thriller, Horror

Director: Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia

Writers: David Desola, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, Egoitz Moreno

Stars: Milena Smit, Hovik Keuchkerian, Natalia Tena
Plot: The film returns to the world of “The Platform,” a large, tower-style “Vertical Self-Management Center” prison that houses various criminals and willing participants. The dozens of floors (333 to be exact) house two occupants per floor and a free-floating platform delivers food to them on a daily schedule. They also begin to attack each other on each level due to some unwilling to follow established tradition of saving food for others. This begins to sow the seeds of mutiny against the established order.

I eat pizza every day.
Garlic shrimp, I’d say.
Could the vanilla ice cream be served on a separate dish, please?
And I want the yolk to be solid.
With some bulgur wheat.
The one with the most meat.

And with turmeric.

[man with shaved head] Can you guarantee that I’ll have pizza every day?
[male interviewer] I guarantee it.
[man with shaved head] I want you to know that I’ll be upset if that’s not the case.
[male interviewer] Uh…
How upset?
You know the reason why I’m here, right?
[pages rustle]
[male interviewer] Hmm.
It says here that you tried to set fire to your parents’ house
while they were asleep.
Well, that’s how upset.

[Frenchman] Whoa! Hey, no.
[Frenchman’s cellmate] No!
[Frenchman] Fucking new guys.
How many times do we need to tell you?
That I’m only entitled to eat my dish?
Or something you swap with someone else voluntarily, yes.
It’s the Law.
[chuckles]
You mean the Law that means absolutely nothing to whoever ate my dish?
[Frenchman’s cellmate] We’ll solve it,
but you can’t behave like a Barbarian who eats whatever he likes.
No, no. The Barbarians are the guys on 21 who ate my stuff.
I, at least, should be able to have the right to eat something…
You have the right to let us, the Loyalists, protect your dish. Yes?
That’s what we’re doing.




If this is the way you, the Loyalists, handle everything,
then I think we’re gonna have a big problem.
[laughs] It’s not easy, but since the Revolution of Solidarity began,
each month, the Pit gets fairer.
And with everyone’s support, the Law will soon reach the last level.
Don’t you see that if you eat the food that another person has ordered,
they will certainly feel… aggrieved
and legitimized to eat whatever they want?
That it will be detrimental to other people,
which will affect many more.
And that will generate a chain disaster that will leave those below without food.
Are you done now?
Listen to me, you dumbass,
if you eat that chicken wing, that’s what will happen.
She called me a dumbass.
[softly] Watch what this dumbass does.
[cellmate] Yes. That’s what will happen.
Sure. That’s easy for you to say.
No one has eaten any of your fucking croquettes, have they?
Do you want one?
[sniffs]
Okay.
But I don’t want any surprises tomorrow, you hear me?
Fine. Just make sure you eat it before the platform leaves.
The Administration doesn’t allow us to keep the food.




They punish us for it. Just once, if you know what I mean.
I understand.
And why don’t they punish the motherfuckers
from 21 who ate my pizza?
[Frenchman] Only eating our dishes,
it is a rule we have established among ourselves,
not the Administration.
And remember, you’re lucky you woke up on Level 24.
But next month, it may be a lower one.
But what you have done on your first day is very commendable.
You have respected others, and you’ve kept your level tidy.
Make sure to not let the Pit keep you down.

333.

Tomorrow, our comrades from Levels 19 and 20
will go down to 21 to defend your pizza.
And the ones from Levels 42 and 43 will go down to 44,

[Frenchman] So it’s our fault?
I’m only saying that sometimes, if you grant some freedom…
No, no! You better shut your mouth now!
No? Of course not…
Freedom has nothing to do with eating whatever you like.
Nothing. Okay?
[Perempuán] She’s dead.
[somber music playing]
[Frenchman sighs deeply]
[cries out] You motherfuckers!
Fucking assholes! Fuck!
[grunting and screaming]
[sobbing]
[coldly] That was very brave.
[grunts]
Enough!
[tense music pulsing]
What do we do with him?
[Frenchman] You’ll do nothing.
I’ll go down with him until I find one of the Anointed Ones.
[Zamiatin] The Anointed Ones?
They are the people that were lucky enough to meet the Master.
The man who laid the foundations of the Law.
They are in charge of applying it wisely…
[Zamiatin] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The Master?
[faucet squeaks]
Some people call him
the Messiah
or the Hidalgo.
Nobody knows if he’s still alive.
Or if he ever existed. [scoffs]
[Frenchman sighs]
[mournful music playing]
[Frenchman exhales]
[sniffles]
It was a long time ago.
Before I got here.
The Master sent a message of hope.
It is said that he survived for one full month without eating
on one of the lowest levels.
Meditating.
The next month, he woke up on a level…
a level that the food had never reached.
He cut the flesh from his own thigh…
and he fed all of the needy.
His Anointed Ones.
And since then, month after month,
they have spread his message of solidarity throughout the Pit.
Defending a fair distribution of the food.
[sighs]
It’s something that we all can achieve together.
And if heads have to roll, then so be it.
Whatever you say, Robespierre.
But I haven’t eaten in two days.
And I want my pizza!
[platform whooshes by]
Are you sure about that, Robespierre?
Don’t you think your master
will be thrilled if you cut her into pieces
and shared them out among the needy?
She is already cooked.
[Robespierre] No. Cannibalism is forbidden by the Law
since the Master showed us the way with his sacrifice.
Every day, you come up with a new rule, Robespierre.
[sighs]
[strains]
[unsettling music rises]
[body parts thud]
[fierce growling]
[alert sounds]
[intense, rhythmic music playing]
[exhales softly]
[Barbarian breathing shakily]
[Zamiatin laughs mockingly]
Look. [chuckles scornfully]
[tense music rises]
[water splashes in toilet]
These dishes belonged to the ones who died yesterday.
I have to throw them away.
Throw them away?
[Robespierre] The Law doesn’t allow us more than one.
Yeah, but why?
The arbitrary distribution of the leftovers
grants a privilege to a small few.
And nobody respects a law that allows inequality.
But the distribution doesn’t have to be arbitrary.
We can still eat all of that!
[toilet flushes]
Okay, so…
Mussels, torreznos, and roast lamb.
Now you are the custodians of the meals of those who are gone above you.
Each day, you must check that they are still intact
and get rid of this source of discord.
If you want to, you can swap, but that means you must throw yours away.
[plates clatter]
Okay?
Believe me, this is the best thing in the long run.
Nobody should ever benefit from the murder of a comrade.
[Barbarian breathing shakily]
Allez.
[grunts]
What are they gonna do to him now?
[Barbarian groaning]
It will be severe… but just.
[strains]
[Barbarian groans]
Shh.
I hope to find an Anointed One before reaching the Level 44 barrier.
There are not many left.
[alert sounds]
[platform whirring]
[Robespierre] Respect the Law.
And also enforce it.
[intense music pulsing]
[loud munching]
[intense, rhythmic music building]
[alert sounds]

[toilet flushes]
[chewing loudly]
[intense music continues]
[speaking inaudibly]
[rhythmic music building]
[music subsides]
[low rumbling]
[ethereal music playing]
[rumbling reverberates]
[Zamiatin] Do you believe all that?
It’s the last day.
Show me what you can do.
[ethereal music fades slowly]
I’m more of a science guy.
I’m not as stupid as I look.
I devoted my whole life to pure mathematics.
One day, I quit.
Why’s that?
[charcoal scratching]
[Zamiatin] This is why.
The square root of minus one.
The solution to this root is
what in mathematics is called an imaginary number.
Imaginary.
One day, I concluded that if we accept something
that doesn’t match any physical reality of our universe as a solution,
I could never trust mathematics again.
Or anything else.
[Zamiatin coughs, groans]
I left my job at the university, my investigations.
[unsettling music rises]
And I abandoned my family.
You left your family because of that?
I went back to my parents’.
Do you have kids?
What’s wrong with the imaginary?
[Zamiatin grunts]
And you? Do you have kids?
The imaginary doesn’t exist.
And it doesn’t have a purpose.
What’s your story, Perempuán?
[Perempuán] I need time to…
to forgive myself.
[woman, below] This month, food has reached Level 175!
[man cheers]
[woman] 175!
[inmates cheering and whistling]
[woman] 175!
You hear that? 175.
[woman] Yes!
[Perempuán] Come on.
[Zamiatin] Why?
Let’s dance.
You wanna dance?
You’re crazy.
[“Sleeping Beauty Waltz” by Tchaikovsky playing]
[Zamiatin grunts]
[glumly] Fine.
[enchanting, regal waltz continues]
[dreamlike waltz concludes]
[man 1] No!
[screaming]
[man 2] Oh my God!
[Zamiatin exhales anxiously]
[woman 1, above] 179, cannelloni and sweet and sour pork.
[Perempuán] Pizza and croquettes, here.
[woman 2] Down there, they’re saying they won’t cooperate.
They’ll eat everything that arrives. When it arrives.
What’s your dish?
I ordered a dessert. Pantxineta.
[Zamiatin coughing]
[Perempuán sighs]
It would be nice to have dessert for lunch some days.
[Zamiatin] Can’t you see where we are?
The system is improving every month.
We can’t start doubting it.
[woman 3] 169!
[man 1] 169!
Is there any news from up there?
The chain is cut at 169. We don’t know anything.
[Zamiatin] I hope the Law is being enforced by Robespierre’s gang
and they are kicking ass right now.
[delirious man, below] The Law is love.
The Law is determination.
The Law is love under determination.
Don’t let fools confound you because there is love in the Pit.
They feel alone and helpless, but the Law…
The Law is for everyone.
Last month, he spent 25 days without eating. On 169.
Fucking moron.
My cellmate is new. There’s lots of new people up there.
[woman 2] And below.
That means a lot of people died last month.
We were also new here, and we learned how to respect the Law.
We learned how to respect the Law on Level 24.
[alert sounds]
[platform whirring]
[dishes clatter]
[delirious man, below] We have all been chosen.
We will all be raised on high.
And regrets are nothing but shadows that pass and go away.
And sorrow is not in us.
Strength and love are in us.
Look. Look at the light that the Master radiates upon us.
[tense music building]
[delirious man, echoing] Even if our home is destroyed by fire and sword,
his invisible house will stand.
His invisible house will stand firm.
[coughs weakly]
And you, even you do not yet know his full meaning.
He’s at the center of everything.
He’s the magician!
He is life.
And he gives life.
He is the flame that burns…
[lighter clicks]
[delirious man] In the heart of all mankind
and at the core of all stars.
Look. Look at the light that the Master radiates upon us.
If determination stops when shouting why,
and then determination stops, and it is not done.
The idiot sees the Law but does not understand it.
He is the flame that burns.
Would you fucking stop?
[Zamiatin wheezing]
[blood splatters]
[sounds distort]
[woman 2] It’s the sign!
[woman 1] It’s the Anointed Ones freeing the Pit of the Barbarians.
There’s no more fear.
Instead of murdering everybody, why don’t they come down
and protect our food?
And leave the ones who don’t respect the Law above?
That would be suicide for the rest!
[coughing]
The Law is power, severity, and order.
He who is upright shall remain upright!
He who is filthy shall remain filthy!
Shut up, asshole!
[continues coughing]
[Perempuán] Where’d it come from?
[woman 1] A long way up.
We’ll still have to wait a few more days.
[coughing weakly]
[delirious man] We have to seek and destroy the traitors.
Their death will be beautiful.
Their death will seal our true and only love.
[gently] Do good here,
and you’ll be rewarded forevermore.
[platform whooshes by]
[delirious man] Do good here, and you’ll be rewarded forevermore.
[woman 1] I have good news.
There’s only the blockage on 169 and 168.
Those Barbarians are trying to sabotage the communication,
but the Anointed One who leads the liberation wants us to be strong.
[Zamiatin wheezing]
Listen to me.
He’s asking us to identify the crippled man
and the cross-eyed woman who gorged themselves on 176.
And the giant man who assaulted his male cellmate on 98.
[woman 3 shouts indistinctly]
What was that about 24?
The fat guy on 24! He stole food from his fallen brothers!
A fat man, while he was on level 24, ate from the dishes of his dead comrades.
What a motherfucker.
What level were you on?
On 46.
And you?
[woman 1] 74.
Fine.
Fine.
[Perempuán, gently] Don’t worry. Nobody knows we were on 24.
[Zamiatin, weakly] They saw us.
When the food gets here, we can only eat our dishes.
Or the ones we can exchange.
And I ordered pizza.
I ordered croquettes.
[chuckles sadly, coughs]
Maybe I’ll die if I don’t eat enough.
The day they get here, we’ll have to behave.
But after, we’ll do whatever it takes.
We’ll be punished.
[sighs]
[Perempuán grunts]
[intense music rising]
[male interviewer] No, you’re not here because they’re afraid of you.
You dropped out of school at 16.
All your business ventures failed.
Your wife and kids kicked you out.
And your parents are getting sick of you too.
You were offered a place
because they think you need some… discipline.
[somber music playing]
Discipline?
[grunts]
[Zamiatin] Discipline for what?
[male interviewer] Discipline
to stop you making those pathetic calls for attention.
[Zamiatin breathing shakily]
[coughing]
[lighter clicks]
What are you doing?
[Zamiatin] I’ve made a lot of mistakes.
They are good kids.
Not very clever. They take after their mother.
I don’t harbor resentment.
What do you mean?
[Zamiatin] I ate what wasn’t mine.
Stay away.
I shouldn’t have eaten.
Stay away.
Stay away! Discipline!
[gasps]
I don’t want to drag you down with me.
You don’t deserve to be punished for helping me.
[Perempuán breathing shakily]
Go and see my kids when you get out of here.
Tell them I’ve always loved them.
Tell them that, at least, my end…
wasn’t a lie.
[somber music building]
[crying softly]
[sobbing silently]
[gentle, ethereal vocals rise]
[screaming inaudibly]
[embers crackling]
[ominous droning]
[Perempuán] I’d like to think he didn’t suffer.
[alert sounds]
[bittersweet music fades]
That he died quickly.
[sounds distort]
[excited voices echoing]
[woman 1, above] Hello.
It looks like everything’s good up there.
They haven’t identified any Barbarian.
We have paella and egg fried rice.
[Perempuán] Croquettes.
[bearded Loyalist] Raw vegan salad, entrecôte steak with pepper sauce.
Down to 71, everyone is a Loyalist or a newcomer.
Let’s see how they behave.
[faucet squeaks]
[water running]
[Perempuán] We’ve been lucky.
51’s a good level.
Once a day, a platform with food will go down.
We’ll have a few minutes to eat the dish we’ve chosen.
What did you choose?
[faucet squeaks off]
Hey. Hey!
[snaps fingers]
[ominous music playing]
[Perempuán] What did you choose?
Just plums.
You’ll only be able to eat that unless you arrange an exchange.
Is that your object?
My pillow.
I can’t sleep without it.
[ominous music subsides]
[gentle music playing]
[alert sounds]
[woman 1, above] Some of the newcomers wouldn’t respect the rules.
It looks like there are two obstacles.
One on 46 and another one higher up.
But there is an Anointed One above, and he won’t take long to pacify them.
[plates clatter]
You’ll eat tomorrow.
[platform whirring]
[lighter clicking]
[woman 2] Barbarian! Barbarian! Barbarian! There’s a barbarian on 54!
[man 2, below] 54!
[woman 3] Barbarian on 54!
There’s a Barbarian on 54!
He was pretending to be one of us,
but they recognized him, and he attacked his new cellmate.
[woman 4] The one from 2! He was on 2!
[bearded Loyalist] That one! From 2!
He was on Level 2 last month, and the people from 1 couldn’t stop him.
They said he ate like a pig, the motherfucker!
Every day, until he threw up.
Tomorrow we’ll go down to pacify him!
And that’s it.
I’ll go down with you.
[bearded Loyalist] There’s no need.
We can’t let that son of a bitch escape.
He won’t escape, but the rules are clear.
First, the four people from the levels immediately above.
My cellmate died
because of assholes like that one down there
who stuffed himself on Level 2 last month.
If the Law isn’t respected, people die.
The higher up you are, the more responsibility.
Do you understand?
[tense music playing]
[cellmate] I understand your anger.
It’s people like that who fuck everything up.
[sounds distort]
[lighter clicking rapidly]
[intense music peaks, dies down]
[lighter clicking steadily]
[clicking grows faster]
[distant scream]
[sounds distort]
[man 1] Fuck you!
[woman 1] Yes! Yes! It’s Dagin Babi!
The Anointed One is Dagin Babi! Hey!
It’s Dagin Babi.
The Anointed One is Dagin Babi.
We’re saved.
He will take no prisoners.
[inmates chanting] Babi! Babi! Babi!
[man 4] He has come!
[inmates] Babi! Babi!
Babi! Babi!
[alert sounds]
[distant cheering fades]
[bright music building]
[plates clatter]
[intense music playing]
We can’t let that asshole escape.
What the hell are you doing?
Justice.
[alert sounds]
[platform whirring]
What the fuck? No, you two can’t be down here.
Better six than four.
That’s against the Law.
And you’re endangering the communication chain.
The communication chain can be maintained perfectly well with three empty levels.
But it’s our turn.
No. We’re not getting off.
[Perempuán] You can choose.
Risk your lives with us or stay and don’t break the fucking chain.
You can go down with them. I’ll preserve the chain.
[alert sounds]
[Barbarian] Shut it, motherfuckers!
I’ll fuck you up!
[shouts]
Motherfuckers! You’re useless. Shut up!
We need more people to finish that pig. Orders from above.
[Barbarian] Shut up, son of a bitch. Shut up, or I’ll fucking kill you!
Don’t come down!
What do you want? What do you want? I’ll kill you!
[suspenseful music playing]
[Barbarian] Okay. I’ll kill you all, motherfuckers!
Come down, I dare you!
[shouts]
[grunting]
[screams]
[shrieks]
[shouts]
[grunts]
Girls, I don’t want any trouble. I’ll stop. [panting]

[cellmate] No!

Motherfucker!

Hold on. Wait. Hold on.
Wait, wait.
I haven’t done anything wrong.
[shouts]
[panting]
[Barbarian] Let me keep going.
I’ve been stuck here over a year and a half.
[Perempuán grunts]
[moans]
Please.
[panting] I needed what I ate to recover.
[shouts]
Please, please, please.
I’m just trying to survive in here, like everyone else.
[whimpers, coughs]
[breathing heavily]
[crying softly]
[grunts angrily]
[alert sounds]
[grunts]
No!
No. No!
[Perempuán] No! No!
We have to keep going down!
He won’t get far.
[groaning]
[cellmate] It’s not about him. It’s not about him.
[Perempuán] No?
It’s not about him.
[both panting]
It’s not your first month in the Pit, is it?
[faint, ominous music playing]
[fabric ripping]
[reverberations resonate]
[cellmate] I’ve been here for six months.
[sighs]
[exhales]
On my first day,
my cellmate,
Kekasih,
she explained…
[takes a deep breath]
…the Law, and…
and I understood it.
It’s an unfair law.
Because it just protects the meal we enter the Pit with,
but…
I believed it was a good start.
We always respected the Law.
We only ate our portions
and took part in pacifications when it was necessary.
But one day…
[somber music rising]
…we found a young man.
Malnourished, almost dead.
We took the dish of a dead person
and gave him more food than he was entitled to.
And a few days later…
an Anointed One came.
[sighs]
Dagin Babi.
Dagin Babi is the strictest Anointed One.
He gets stricter every month.
Much more.
He decided to give out an exemplary punishment.
For breaking the Law.
[sighs]
Kekasih resisted, and…
[voice breaking]…she gouged out his eyes.
[exhales shakily]
[sniffles]
Dagin Babi ordered that she be tied naked to the platform
and sent her defenseless to the lower levels.
[sniffles]
They forced me to watch as a few levels down, they ate her alive.
[sobbing]
[gentle music playing]
We will never be safe inside of the Pit.
Never. [sobs softly]
Not all Anointed Ones are the same.
Last month,
one of them arrived in time to save a lot of people from starving to death.
How do you think he opened the way to your level?
We just have to keep on helping.
Being fairer.
We have to hold on until we can get out of here.
[scoffs] Haven’t you noticed?
No one… gets out of here.
No one here will survive.
[somber music playing]
[distant scream above]
[cellmate] But there’s something we can do.
Escape.
[whispering] Escape during the interval.
The what?
At the end of every month, well, to reset the Pit,
they… the gas they’re using
is a variant of sevoflurane.
We have to do it in that moment.
But… what’s going to stop us from sleeping?
Every month, I search for it.
So far I haven’t been lucky.
But we’ll only have one opportunity if we find it.
To do that… we have to keep going down.
[Perempuán] What are we looking for?
[platform whooshes by]
[man moaning above]
[alert sounds]
[tied man] No. No, no, no! [cries out]
[Perempuán gasps]
[blood splatters]
That’s Dagin’s signature. It’s now or never.
[breathing shakily]
[platform whirring above]
Dagin Babi and his people
must be coming down on the platform, but there was a blockage at 46.
They’ll have to stop there to apply their Law.
It’s our chance. We have to go down today.
[alert sounds]
[Perempuán] That plan of yours is crazy.
Enjoy the ride!
What if it doesn’t work?
I don’t know if it’ll work.
But I know what will happen if Dagin Babi reaches us.
[alert sounds]
[platform whirring]
Yeah! That’s what you get! [cackles]
[tied man moaning]
[suspenseful music playing]
Shouldn’t we take him with us?
[alert sounds]
[tied man choking]
[music building]
[man, above] Got what he deserved.
[alert sounds]
[platform clatters]
[sighs shakily]
[Babi] Get off.
[tied man moaning below]
I’ve been told extraordinary things about you.
Yes. About your determination to take part in a pacification,
even though it didn’t concern you.
As a reward, today you’ll be able to drink as much wine as you want
while eating your dishes.
Come on. Don’t be shy.
[cellmate crying softly]
[Babi] Eating is not just a right. It’s a duty.
We need strong men and women to defend the Law.
[tied man crying out below]
Enjoy.
[cellmate sniffles]
[whistles]
[Loyalists clamoring]
Let me go.
Let me go.
[alert sounds]
[Perempuán] Let me go!
Let me go!
[blond Loyalist] What is this?
Get off me!
Please.
[Perempuán gasps]
We must obey the Law.
And be sure to enforce it.
Always.
Without exception.
You know the Rule of the Next Four, right?
Yes, of course you know it.
If you know it, then tell me.
Why the fuck did you let them take part in the pacification?
[bearded Loyalist, muffled] I tried to stop them. They didn’t let me!
[Babi] Pardon?
[blond Loyalist] I…
I… I told them that it wasn’t right.
But you did nothing to stop them.
No, but I stood my ground, so the chain of communication wasn’t lost at any time.
Sure. Even a blind man can see how brave you are for doing so.
I have an idea.
Today’s impossible,
but tomorrow you can drink all the wine you want too, all right?
All the wine to wash down your last dinner.
After that, you’ll be executed for the double dereliction of your duties.
But… [muffled] What do you mean, double dereliction?
I…
Yes, double dereliction.
First, you didn’t go down when you had to. And second, you let them do it.
You also let them go down.
So you will lose an arm.
[grunts] And her?
Tell me why only me and not her!
Didn’t you tell me she was fooled by you? She didn’t know she was breaking the Law.
[timidly] But, um, having more people seemed right to me.
One does not interpret the Law!
One obeys it!
[young woman breathing shakily]
[Babi] The exception of the righteous is the excuse of the disloyal.
You committed an offense.
You’ll lose an arm.
You can’t punish those who obey the Law!
No. No, no, no, no. You’re wrong.
He who breaches the Law does not defend it.
Furthermore, he who acts like that
will sooner or later interpret the Law according to his own interests.
Listen to me.
Many people have died or lost a lot to arrive at this day.
I lost my eyes.
[Perempuán grunting]
And your friend should know what it’s like to lose something.
[cellmate sobbing]
Though it appears you… you haven’t learned your lesson.
Yes.
You have committed your second offense.
And now you deserve the same fate as your dead friend.
[Perempuán] No! Motherfucker!
[Babi] None of this is arbitrary. Absolutely nothing.
We kill to build a future where no one will kill anymore.
There are Barbarians down there.
And only fear subdues beasts.
And terror… is the message.
[creaking resonates]
[young man] If you let her live, she’ll escape.
[cellmate panting]
[Babi] Speak, son.
They have a plan.
Tell me about it.
I heard their talk about stuff that’s important.
They thought I was sleeping.
But I wasn’t.
Because I know being awake is the best way to learn things.
And she talked about the place
where this world is created again and again.
And she told her that if they ate a dog,
they could wake up from the dream and escape.
And they wanted to kidnap me, but I don’t eat dog.
[group laughing]
Shh!
[laughter stops]
[intense music rises]
Calm down, son. Hmm?
Nobody will eat any dog.
[muffled clamoring]

Is this your first month in the Pit?
[water running]
[faucet squeaks off]
[woman 1, above] Good morning, neighbors. Another month in the Pit.
Here we have red sea bream and caviar, but we don’t swap it for nothing, okay?
Let’s see what these beggars have.
Don’t talk to the people above us.
[man 1, below] We’re at Level fucking 73. Where’s my food? I’m hungry.
Stupid fuckin’ Loyalists.
Shit.
[man 2] Who are you? Identify yourself.
[man 1] Identify yourself.
[man 2] Where were you last month?
Don’t talk with the ones below either.
Talking… is draining.
[man 1] I followed the Law!
A month ago, at 203, nobody was there to help.
Nobody.
[Perempuán] What object did you choose?
[darkly whimsical music playing]
[Trimagasi] I brought it to cut the bread into slices.
At home, I buy it sliced.
But here, hmm… I don’t know.
Can I hold it?
[cellmate] There’s something we can do.
Escape during the interval.
[Perempuán] But what’s going to stop us from sleeping?
[cellmate] Every month, I search for it.
[echoing] We have to keep going down. We have to find the drowning dog.
[alert sounds]
[tense, rhythmic music playing]
[platform clatters]
[woman] Oh my God, look at this guy.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
You gotta respect the Law. He won’t stop!
Hey, we gotta respect the Law!
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
You can’t step on the food, you animal! Don’t fucking look at me like that.
I’m gonna go down there and kick your ass.
You can’t step on the food!
You better come with me.
[woman] Pigs. Get down from there!
[man] You gotta respect the Law.
[woman] Is she deaf? She must be deaf.
This girl’s deaf. She doesn’t understand what I’m saying.
Get down.
Get down!
Coming?
Obviously.
[sounds distort]
Let’s go.
You won’t get anywhere alone.
If you want to face the Loyalists, you’ll have to act like them.
In a group.
[alert sounds]
Get down and obey the Law.
Calm down.
I will defend the Law with my life.
[Perempuán] Are you sure?
[man in sunglasses] Listen.
No one should restrict our freedom.
No one. We’re old enough to not have anyone tell us what to do.
This lamb is fucking delicious.
[man, above] Barbarians are comin’ down. They’re fuckin’ Barbarians.
They’re Barbarians.
Fuckin’ Barbarians!
[platform clatters]
If you want to survive the punishment and torture, get on.
[man, above] Tomorrow the Anointed One will come down.
All Loyalists will assemble, and we’ll come down to slaughter you.
One by one. That’s right.
Do you hear me?!
We should neutralize the other one.
[man, above] We’ll kill all of you. You are gonna regret this.
We don’t do things that way.
Fucking Barbarians!
[laughs]
[man in sunglasses] We were born free. These Loyalists hate freedom.
That’s why they hate us.
Because we’re free.
And we’ll always be free.
They can’t stop us from doing whatever we want.
This is full of food. Why can’t we eat whatever we want?
We have been dreaming of freedom all our lives.
Get on, comrade! Look what we’ve done.
[man in sunglasses] We’ve been here longer than them, and we have more rights.
[bearded man] For our freedom!
[long-haired man] Stop it.
[bearded man] Eat it.
Eat it! Good, right?
[long-haired man cries out]
[Trimagasi] Are you stupid? Get on!
Freedom is up there!
Get on here now!
Nobody can force me to get on anything!
[man in sunglasses] They want us repressed.
Crushed.
This is our moment.
[clamoring]
For freedom. For freedom! For freedom!
For freedom!
[intense music playing]
[flatly] That’s it. We’re staying here.
There’s enough of us.
Free men and women… [chuckles]…we’ll stay here.
[Barbarians murmuring]
[soft, ethereal music playing]
He painted it on a wall in his house.
Later on, they transferred it to this canvas.
Isn’t it amazing?
It’s the original.
I’m so pleased that we’re all finally doing something
about these awful sectarians and all their strict laws.
But we must rally together and organize.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I’d like to welcome you to my humble abode.
Your humble pile of shit.
[Barbarians laugh]
[older man] Hey, she’s a comrade.
I think this area right here will be…
Shut up, you old bitch.
[older man] Mind your manners.
[bearded man] You wanna talk about manners? Seriously?

What the fuck? Hey, get up.
[man] Okay.
[man in sunglasses] Get up!
Motherfuckers!
They’re coming down!
Come on!
Everyone get ready!

Hold on!
[platform clatters]
Fuck.
What’s going on?
[Babi] Day three.
There he is, son of a bitch.
[Babi] You won’t eat anything for the rest of the month.
Every day, the platform will go down, yes.
But it will be empty. Without food.
And once you’re all hungry and exhausted,
that’s when we’ll go down and kill every one of you cursed nonbelievers.
Motherfucker!
Come down here and say that!
And those bastards down there, are you also gonna sentence them to death?
No… there are plenty of sons of bitches like you down there.
Yeah. What are you gonna do about them? Are you gonna sentence them to death too?
Yes. It’s a terrible price, true.
But defending the Law is worth that price. Listen carefully.
If you surrender,
only the warlords of this absurd rebellion will be tortured.
The only warlord I can see here is you.
Comrades! Comrades!
Comrades, listen.
He’s offering us a solution!
And a reasonable one.
Shut your mouth, you old motherfucker. I’ll fucking kill you, you son of a bitch!
[platform whirring]
Get back up here, assholes!
Where the fuck are you going? Get back!
[Barbarians clamoring]
The blind man is just bluffing, all right?
He won’t sentence his people to death.
What if you’re wrong? Huh?
What are we gonna eat?
What do we do?
[chatter dies down]
[Trimagasi] I’ve got an idea.
What if we go down and eat his people?
[dramatic stinger]
[Barbarians laugh]
[man in sunglasses] You hear that, you blind motherfucker?
We’ll go down there, and we’re gonna eat your people!
[Barbarians laugh and cheer]
[Perempuán] After years of hard work,
my big night came at last.
It was my fourth exhibition.
[shouting inaudibly]
[Perempuán] I shared it with some influential artists.
I participated with a series of sculptures that represented animal brutality.
My boyfriend came to see me.
And he brought his son with him so I could finally meet him.
And, well…
[takes a deep breath]
…it’s impossible for kids to stay still.
At least, not him.
One of my pieces
was a beastly dog.
Cruel,
atrocious.
His claws were sharp blades that faced the viewer.
[spits]
[painting owner] You can’t go on like this.
If you don’t eat, you’ll die.
[Perempuán] They warned me it would be dangerous.
But to me, that risk and that boldness,
was what made it really special.
I refused to let them establish a safety perimeter.
The kid wouldn’t stop running.
Until he stumbled.
One of the claws…
One of the blades…
went through his eye.
I’d like to think he didn’t suffer.
That he died quickly.
The lawyers did a good job.
The judge saw it as an accident.
The insurance company paid.
And I became one of the most valued artists of my generation.
All the pieces of animal brutality
were sold for millions.
Especially the dog.
[man in sunglasses] Barbarians!
Go for the ankles!
[shouts]
[Barbarians] Go for the ankles!
[man in sunglasses] Let the revolution begin!
[man 1] Here it comes!
[bearded man] Be ready!
[man in sunglasses] Now or never!
[Barbarians chanting aggressively]
[sounds become muffled]
Barbarians, right now!

[Babi moaning]
[Perempuán grunts]
[Babi] You.
[weakly] Finish what you started. Come on.
You’re defenseless, and I have a knife.
[Babi exhales]
[gently] But I think I have a better idea.
I could heal your wounds
and feed you for the rest of your days with your own flesh.
I would slice it carefully so you could go on living.
That way, you’d be worthy of your master.
But I won’t do it.
I won’t use my imagination to torture anyone.
[Babi] You don’t need to.
You have already condemned us all.
[Perempuán] They told me the dog was dangerous.
But I still went ahead anyway.
If I could turn back time…
To save him.
But it’s not possible.
What are you looking for here?
Time.
I need time to forgive myself.
I need to escape.
[platform whirring]
[Perempuán] To forget what I did.
[platform whooshes by]
[gentle, ethereal music playing]
[Perempuán strains]
[grunts]
I’m going.
Are you staying, or are you coming too?
[Trimagasi] No.
This was the best month of my life.
[Perempuán sniffles]
[Trimagasi] We’re all prisoners of ourselves.
And from that,
there’s no possible escape.
[knife clatters]
[Perempuán sniffles]
[grunts]
[cellmate] When we smell the gas…
That’s the moment.
[Perempuán] But what’s gonna stop us from sleeping?
[cellmate] If everything goes well, they’ll think we’re dead.
But we’ll wake up.
We’ll let them take us out from the top, with the corpses, and then…
[Perempuán exhales softly]
…we’ll have to improvise.
[Perempuán] What if it doesn’t go well?
Maybe we’ll die.

* * *
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
MAN 1: Start talking.
MAN 2: I’m not sure if we’re on the air.
This is a series of explosions…
WOMAN 1: We’re being told this is a major incident.
The emergency is a major incident.
MAN 3: …bright lights and an orange glow.
WOMAN 2: That was the moment the meteor hit.
MAN 4: It does now appear to be a major attack.
WOMAN 3: Since they landed outside Hamburg five years ago… they have steadily advanced across Europe. We’ve suffered millions of casualties.
The evacuation of key government officials continuing.
MAN 5: Nothing has stopped their advance.
MAN 6: In human costs, the Europeans have paid the highest price.
They have the ability to mimic and even anticipate our actions.
BRIGHAM: If we do not defeat them in France… we’ll be fighting them in London then New York, then Tokyo.
[CROWD YELLING]
All of humanity’s at stake.
MAN 7: After five years we finally have a victory.
WOMAN 4: These pictures are just in from Verdun.
MAN 8: One of the striking things was how low casualties were… and how little damage…
MAN 9: We have seen a stunning victory here today.
HILL: How do you convince people that this is a fight that can be won?




This is an alien invasion in a global war.
With the new jacket technology and limited training… we’ve been able to create super-soldiers.
Look at Rita Vrataski, the Angel of Verdun.
WOMAN 5: They’re calling her the Angel of Verdun.
She is seen as the new hope for this war.
WOMAN 6: It’s extraordinary.
With the new jacket technology and limited training…
Rita Vrataski was able to kill… hundreds of mimics on only her first day.
MAN 10: Is the tide of this war changing?
WOMAN 7: The Army attribute this success to a revolutionary new technology:
The Exosuit jacket.
[PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
She was able to kill hundreds of mimics on only her first day in combat.
Imagine an army of Rita Vrataskis.
BURNETT: We’re holding them back at the English Channel, but for how long?
MAN 11: This is dangerous talk. People are suspicious about this invasion.
MAN 12: Over 17 nations have joined the United Defense Force… which hopes to push them back. We’ve got them contained.
And with this new technology, we’re gonna defeat them.
Operation Downfall is going to be the largest mechanized invasion in history.
We will be victorious. We fight. That’s what we do.
CAGE: Major William Cage, United States Military Media.
Welcome to London, major.
The general will see you now.
Thank you.
BRIGHAM: Operation Downfall.




The entire UDF, invading from France, the Mediterranean, Scandinavia…
relieving pressure on the eastern front…
allowing the Russians and Chinese to push the enemy back.
We all meet in the middle exterminating this mimic scourge along the way.
A lot of good soldiers are gonna die tomorrow, major.
When all the smoke clears… and the body bags start coming home, people look for someone to blame… someone like me.
Ideally, I’d prefer a different scenario.
Please.
A best-selling memoir, perhaps.
Maybe a career in politics?
Off the top of my head, I would go with the sense of manifest destiny.
Rags to riches. Rapid rise through the ranks.
Born to deliver us. And the people, well, they love that sort of thing.
You misunderstand. I didn’t ask you here to sell me. Sell the invasion.
Okay.
You ship for the coast in one hour. Your camera crew is standing by.
You’ll be on the beach with the first wave.
I’m sorry, the first wave? The beach? You mean the front?
France.
Satellites show minimal enemy movement on the coast.
Little resistance.
A little excitement, something to tell your grandchildren.
While I appreciate the confidence, general…
I do this to avoid doing that.
[CHUCKLES]




I was in ROTC in college.
The war broke out, I lost my advertising firm…
and here I am.
You know, I do what I do, and you do what you do.
But…
I’m not a soldier, really.
No, of course you’re not.
I’m embedding you with several hundred thousand who are.
While it is an honor, I’m afraid I’m gonna have to decline.
Can’t stand the sight of blood. Not so much as a paper cut.
[CHUCKLES]
Uh, but, uh…
sitting here thinking about this…
a couple of names come to mind…
that I feel I could recommend to you.
It’s not an offer, major. It’s an order.
General, I am an officer in the United States military.
You don’t even have the authority.
I have spoken to your CO.
You are now under my command.
You will retain your present rank of course.
My secretary has all the details.
Do a good job, major.
Good luck. You are dismissed.
General?




I just inspired millions of people to join your army.
And when the body bags come home and they’re looking…
for someone to blame, how hard do you think it would be…
for me to convince people to blame you?
I’d imagine the general would prefer to avoid that.
Are you blackmailing me, major?
I would prefer…
not to be filming acts of heroism and valor on that beach tomorrow.
You won’t be.
I’m glad we could, uh, work this out.
Now if you’ll excuse me, general. I…
Thank you.
[CHATTERING]
Arrest this man.
What?
SOLDIER 1: Hey! Hey!
SOLDIER 2: Stop right there!
Hey! Stop!
Get out of the way!
Out of the way!
SOLDIER 3: Hold it!
MAN 1: Left flank, march!
MAN 2: Forward, march!
About-turn!
[PEOPLE SPEAKING OVER PA IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES]
WOMAN [OVER PA]: Supplies closing in 10 minutes.
SERGEANT: On your feet maggot!
That is no way to address an officer, sergeant.
It’s how I address a slack-jawed recruit before I bust his hole
with my boot heel, maggot.
FARELL: Hold up there, sergeant.
Can I help you, sir?
Where the hell am I, sergeant?
Forward Operating Base Heathrow.
You just came in with the fresh recruits.
Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?
No, sir, you do not.
My name is Major William Cage.
I’m an American officer.
Officer?
This is processing.
There’s no officers here. I got this, sergeant.
How the hell did you end up in processing?
What was it? Poker night? Bachelor party?
If it’s all the same to you, sergeant…
I’d like to explain that to my commanding officer in Washington.
If you’ll take me to a phone…
Haven’t you heard?
We’re T-minus-Haul-Ass-H-Hour.
We’re fixing to invade France.




This whole FOB’s on lockdown. No calls, in or out.
Name is Farell.
That’s right.
Master Sergeant Farell.
You’re an American.
No, sir. I’m from Kentucky.
Okay. Well, look at me.
And look at where I am.
I’ve been railroaded.
It’s obvious I don’t belong here.
So please, sergeant, there has to be a way I can make a phone call.
I’ll get you sorted out, sir.
Thank you.
Right this way.
CAGE: Where you from in Kentucky?
FARELL: Little town called Science Hill. Heard of it?
I have now.
Where you from?
Cranbury, New Jersey.
They grow a lot of cranberries there?
Tomatoes. Best you ever had.
Why they call it Cranberry, then?
Why they call it Science Hill?
Never asked. Don’t care.
After you.
You’re not taking me to a phone, are you?
No, I am not.
Seems about the only honest thing you said to me so far is your name.
Says here you’re a deserter.
It says here you were caught impersonating an officer. It says here…
you’d likely try to make an outside call, compromise security of this operation.
Anything to get out of combat duty tomorrow.
But that’s not gonna happen.
Ever.
Private Cage.
[WILLY MOON’S “RAILROAD TRACK” PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Take you down to the early days
When the champagne
Flow like a river stream
FARELL: Rumor is a terrible thing.
Come nightfall, these men will all reach the same conclusion.
That you’re a coward and a liar, putting your life above theirs.
Good news is there’s hope for you, private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.
Battle is the great redeemer.
The fiery crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.
The one place where all men truly share the same rank…
regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were going in.
[MAN WHISTLES]




Squad! This here is Private Cage.
Private Cage, J Squad.
Isn’t that an officer’s uniform?
Those sure ain’t officer cufflinks.
FARELL: I see everyone is having a productive morning.
You know, it gives me a swell of pride knowing soldiers of your…
caliber will be leading the charge tomorrow.
Tip of the spear.
Edge of the knife.
Crack of my…
ass.
NANCE: Oh, shit.
FARELL: Private Kimmel, what is my view of gambling…
…in the barracks?
You dislike it, Sergeant Farell.
Nance, why do I dislike it?
It entertains the notion our fate is in hands other than our own.
FARELL: And what is my definitive position on the concept of fate, chorus?
ALL: Through readiness and discipline, we are masters of our fate.
FARELL: You might call that notion ironic.
But trust me, you’ll come around.
Private Cage is a deserter.
I’m making you all personally responsible for his deliverance.
He will be combat ready at 0600 tomorrow.
Combat ready?
FARELL: Cage is under the delusion he does not belong here.
We must dissuade him of this delusion.
If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him until he can’t piss standing up.
You have to listen to me.
I will never be combat ready.
I envy you, Cage.
Tomorrow morning, you will be baptized. Born again.
PT! Ten minutes!
So everybody
Come along with me
Go down the river And wash your feet
To where the people Live a life that’s sweet
And a place that’s ripe
You’re not in uniform… private.
[ALARM WAILING]

Oh, for chrissake, Kimmel.
I got to be free, man.
Let’s get this show on the road. I gotta suit up.
What’s that noise? That…

Listen, I’ve never been in one of these.
I’ve never been with two girls at the same time.
You can bet when that day comes, I’ll make it work.
Kimmel.
It’s Griff.
Griff. Griff. You bet.
Just think about this, man. I could hurt somebody with it.
Not with the safety on, you won’t.
But…
Where is the safety?
MAN 2: Exactly.
MAN: It’s time.
Bloody hell, it’s the Full Metal…
Move.
FARELL: Griff.
Sarge?
Take care of Private Cage.
What, all day?
Something tells me it won’t be nearly that long.
Cage!
Cage!
Cage!
FARELL: We lost Germany.
We lost France.
If we lose today we won’t get to fight another.
I know the pressure on you is enormous.
Two minutes to drop.
It’s all right to be scared.
Remember, there’s no courage without fear.

Oi, mate! I think there’s something wrong with your suit.
Yeah. There’s a dead guy in it.

No, I’m not.

I’m hit.
How bad is it?
Is there a lot of blood?
You have a hole in your chest.
Really?
RITA: Yeah.
Did you just take my…?
My battery?
No, no, no. Holy fu…
Aah!
SERGEANT: On your feet maggot!
Sergeant Farell!
Sergeant Farell.
FARELL: Can I help you, sir?
My name is Major Bill Cage. I’m U.S. Army Media Relations.
I was not at a bachelor party or a poker game.
You have an order that says I’m a deserter caught impersonating an officer.
But what it doesn’t say is…
your name is Master Sergeant Farell from Science Hill, Kentucky.
If you give me 30 seconds to explain how I know that,
you may save the lives of every soldier on this base.
You have to listen to me! They know we’re coming! They’re waiting for us!
I have been there! I’ve seen it!
You’re all doomed! You’re doomed!
Okay. Okay. Okay, I’m fine. I’m fine.
This is J Squad. Yes?
This is J Squad, yes.
Not that I should know that, but okay.
Have any of you met me before?
Bitch, I don’t know you.
Exactly! Yes!
Thank you.
Your name is Nance. You’re Bibble.
Kibble… Kimmel! You fight balls out. Literally.
Ford. Skinner. Griff.
You’re…
He doesn’t talk much.
But there’s a card game under the bed.
Thanks a lot, asshole.
CAGE: Kimmel’s working on a flush. Spades… No, clubs.
You’re gonna make them eat those cards.
Am I right?
Now…
what I’m about to tell you sounds crazy.
It’s true.
And you have to listen to me.
Your very lives depend on it.
[GRUNTING]
FARELL: One minute!
GRIFF: What? What is he saying? Nance! What is he saying?
[ALARM WAILING]
On my mark! Stand by to deploy!
The ship is about to explode!
KIMMEL: Yeah! Whoo!
We made it!
Thank God, we made it!
Aah!
SERGEANT: …before I bust your hole with my boot heel!
KIMMEL: Yeah! Whoo!
We made it!
Thank God, we made it!
CAGE: Aah!
I’m sorry. I’m trying to save you.
We’re getting slaughtered. You need to get us off this beach.
We have to go. This drop ship is about to explode.
We have to go now.
Wait.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
This ship is going to explode!
What are you doing?
Find me when you wake up.
What?
Come find me when you wake up.
Aah!
SERGEANT: On your feet maggot!
Get in line before I bust your hole with my boot heel!
FARELL: Good news is there’s hope for you, private.
Battle is the great redeemer.
The fiery crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.
The one place where all men truly sh…
[WILLY MOON’S “RAILROAD TRACK” PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Squad, this here is…
Private Cage. And you must be J Squad.
It’s good to meet you.
Isn’t that an officer’s uniform?
SKINNER: Those sure…
These sure ain’t officer’s cufflinks.
Keys in the… left pocket, probably.
FARELL: Private Cage is a deserter.
I’m making you all personally responsible for his deliverance.
He will be combat ready by 0600 tomorrow.
Private Cage is under the delusion he does not belong here.
We must dissuade him of this delusion.
If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him…
Oh, no. I’m not gonna run.
Not a chance.
Till he can’t piss standing up.
Thank you, Sergeant Farell.
What next? A little, uh, PT?
FARELL: PT! Ten minutes!
FARELL: Left! Left! Left!
What are you? Sound off!
ALL: I’m a warrior!
What do warriors do?
ALL: Kill!
FARELL: What are you gonna do?
ALL: Kill!
FARELL: What are you gonna do?
ALL: Kill!
FORD: It’s gonna be my 20th battle tomorrow.
You haven’t been in 20 battles, mate.
I have too.
You’re gonna dump your load the second we hit the beach.
Why don’t you get yourselves a cup of shut-the-hell-up?
FORD: Ha-ha. You funny, girl.
I bet I set a record tomorrow.
Fastest time running backwards, Ford, slipping in your own shit.
Knock off the grab-ass!
Grab this, sarge!
Hold up!
Private, drop and give me…
Fifty, sarge?
That’s right.
Fifty.
Platoon!
Drop and give me 50!
Compliments of Private Cage.
CAGE: Thank you, sarge.
FARELL: And one!
ALL: One!
FARELL: And two!
ALL: Two!
FARELL: And three!
ALL: Three!
CAGE: Aah!
Oh!
What the hell were you thinking?
FARELL: There’s hope for you, private. Hope in the form of glorious combat.
Battle is the great redeemer.
FARELL: Three!
ALL: Three!
FARELL: Four!
ALL: Four!
FARELL: Five!
ALL: Five!
CAGE: Excuse me. Sergeant Vrataski.
Excuse me.
Sergeant Vrataski?
[ALARM SOUNDING]
Excuse me.
Yes? Who said you could talk to me?
Have I got something on my face?
You did. You did.
Tomorrow. At the beach.
Tomorrow. At the beach.
We meet.
You said to find you when I wake up.
You do know what’s happening to me.
Come with me.
Now.
You don’t talk to anyone about this but me.
The best-case scenario is you’re gonna end up in a psych ward.
Worst case, you’ll get dissected for study. Are we clear?
Yes?
Yes.
First time you died, what happened?
You killed a mimic?
Yes.
Describe it.
It was different.
It was bigger. Bluish.
And you got covered in its blood.
As a matter of fact, I did.
They know we’re coming on the beach tomorrow.
It’s a slaughter, isn’t it?
How do you know this?
Could you just…? Wait!
Wait. Wait.
Would you explain to me what the hell is happening.
What happened to you happened to me.
I had it. I lost it. Okay?
That’s great. There’s a cure. How do I get rid of this?
First, I need your help.
Help with what exactly?
Winning the war.
Let’s go! Come on!
CARTER: Rita, what is this?
What are you doing here? You gotta give me some warning.
Who’s this?
He’s me. Before Verdun.
He’s gonna help us.
What? You mean he’s…?
Yes.
When did he die? Where?
On the beach. Tomorrow.
How many fingers am I holding up behind my back?
How should I know that?
CARTER: Okay.
So this is the first time we’ve had this conversation.
You should try this on him.
What is that?
It doesn’t work.
Has he had any visions yet?
Visions of what?
There’s still time.
Yes.
Time? Look, I’m sorry.
Who is this? Who are you?
I’m Dr. Carter. Particle physics. Advanced microbiology.
He’s also the only other person who’ll believe what’s happening to you.
No one understands mimic biology better than him.
He’s a top analyst at Whitehall.
Well, I mean, I was until I met Rita and now I’m just…
a “mechanic with psychiatric delusions.”
Carter.
Show him.
Yeah, right.
Right. Well, first of all…
you’re not fighting an army.
You have to think of this as a single organism.
Now, these common drones, they act like its claws.
And Alphas, like the one that you killed, are much more rare.
CARTER: Yeah. They’re like one in…
…6.18 million, by my guess.
RITA: Yes.
They act as the enemy’s…
They’re like its central nervous system.
But this…
is the brain.
It controls them all. And this is the Omega.
And the Omega has the ability to control time.
Whenever an Alpha is killed…
an automatic response is triggered.
The Omega starts the day over again.
But you see, this time, it can remember what’s going to happen just like you do.
CARTER: It knows exactly what we’re gonna do before we’re gonna do it.
And an enemy that knows the future can’t lose.
It can’t lose.
But if that’s true, how did you win at Verdun?
We were allowed to win.
This thing wants us to believe we can win.
It wants us to throw everything we have into the invasion.
Operation Downfall isn’t our endgame it’s the enemy’s.
CARTER: The thing you’ve got to understand is this is a perfectly evolved…
world-conquering organism.
For all we know, there are millions of those asteroids…
floating around in the cosmos like a virus.
They’re just waiting to crash-land into a world with just the right conditions.
All they need is for the dominant life form to attack and:
RITA: There’ll be nothing to stop the mimics…
from conquering the rest of the world.
Unless you change the outcome.
Me?
When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently entered the enemy’s nervous system.
Cage, you’ve seized control of the Omega’s ability to reset the day.
How’s that even possible?
CARTER: Perhaps this organism’s…
only vulnerability, its only vulnerability…
is humanity.
Regardless of that, you control the power now.
Just as I did in Verdun.
So I’m resetting the day?
Okay.
How do I control it?
You have to die.
Every day.
Until the Omega’s destroyed.
First of all…
this is a terrific presentation.
Terrific.
I know the general.
We should take this to him.
You just tell him everything you told me.
I went to see the general.
Any number of times.
Psych ward. Dissection. Remember?
What are you expecting from me?
Have you seen anything strange?
Is he shitting me?
Visions.
Visions. Have you seen any visions like that?
The Omega senses when it’s losing control of its power.
Even now it’s mentally searching to find you.
RITA: When it’s close to finding you you will start having visions.
You’ll start to see that.
You’ll even see where it is.
And you had these visions?
Yes.
But eventually you saw it. I mean, you actually saw it.
Right?
Never in the flesh.
So this is all just some…
theory.
You don’t know if this thing even exists.
The visions showed me it was at Verdun. I could see it. I…
I just…
lost the power before I could get to it.
CARTER: And by the time we took Verdun…
the Omega was gone.
Okay. So all I have to do is… wait to have these visions…
and then tell you where this Omega thing is.
No. Cage.
You’re gonna get me there. And I’m gonna kill it.
Get you there?
I’m not even trained for combat.
COMPUTER: Reload.
Reload.
[GRUNTING]
Are you all right, Cage?
I think I broke something.
What?
My back.
The only thing I can feel are my lips.
Now listen carefully. This is a very important rule.
This is the only rule.
You get injured on the field, you better make sure you die.
Why?
Last time I was in combat…
I was hit.
I was bleeding out. Just not fast enough.
I woke up in a field hospital…
with three pints of someone else’s blood and I was out.
I lost the power. Do you understand?
Think we better start over.
Don’t you?
What?
Aah!
FARELL: No one knows what happened to Private Cage!
You dumb-ass. He was right next to you.
You don’t know where that slippery son of a bitch went?
No, sarge!
All right.
Let’s do another 50, shall we?
And one!
No, wait! Wait. My name is Bill Cage.
I… We met on the beach. We meet on the beach. Tomorrow.
I have what you had.
Ugh. All right, let’s go again.
You don’t have time to think. Remember.
It’s not enough knowing where they’re going to be.
You have to know how to kill them.
Hold on. Hold on. Listen. List…
Okay. Do it.
Unh!
On your feet, maggot!
CAGE: Stop! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Stop! Wait! Wait a second!
Wait a sec. Wait a second.
You know, I’ve been thinking.
I mean, this thing’s in my blood.
So maybe there’s some way… I can transfer it to you.
I’ve tried everything. It doesn’t work.
I mean, have you…
you know…
tried all the options?
Oh, you mean sex. Yep. Tried it.
How many times?
All right.
Left.
Left! Left, left!
Keep your eyes open.
Again.
Again.
Again.
Again.
Just wait! Wait.
I think I’m okay.
Unh!
On your feet!
Maggot! Maggot!
I’m trying to be nice to you, maggot! Move!
RITA: You okay, Cage?
Oh yeah, yeah! I’m good! I’m good!
Your leg’s broken.
No. I can still feel my toes.
Oh, come on.
Aah!
CARTER: Rita. Rita. What is this? What are you doing here?
Who’s this guy?
He’s me…
…before Verdun.
Before Verdun.
What do you mean? He’s…?
Yes. Yes.
When did he die?
Where?
On the beach. Tomorrow.
I’m Bill Cage. You’re Dr. Carter.
We’ve had this conversation before. Two fingers behind your back.
I’ve had the visions.
I’ve seen the Omega.
CARTER: Um…
It’s pretty much game over tomorrow.
So can we move this along?
Okay. Where?
There’s a dam.
It’s in the mountains. I saw German writing.
RITA: Do you think you can work out where that is?
I mean, there can’t be… too many places that fit that description.
I’ll see what I can do.
Training’s over. I’ll see you tomorrow.
We don’t even know where we’re going.
We will soon enough.
In the meantime, you need to figure out a way to get us off that beach.
RITA: What next? Where are we going?
Which way? Focus. Which way?
I’m thinking.
Okay.
CAGE: Oh, man!
RITA: How far did we make it?
You know, it’s hard to say, really.
CAGE: Hold! Hold!
Okay, go!
Son of a bitch!
I thought stepping left, ducking… Just for the record.
It was pretty specific.
Stepping left, ducking right.
Stepping left, ducking right. Move on.
CAGE: Hold on! Now, remember:
Across the trench, 12:00!
Then look to your right!
You’re not being specific.
You need to be specific. Otherwise, I’m dead.
Rita.
RITA: Cage!
Paces up to the top of the trench. I’m gonna step left.
A mimic there, which I’ll kill.
…ship explosion. I’m gonna run 30 paces northwest.
I’m gonna duck at the top of that trench and then I’m gonna turn left.
Have I got something on my face?
No.
SKINNER: Cage!
We’ve been looking everywhere for you.
Cage!
Cage, we’ve been looking…
Guys.
Guys. Can we…
just…
not do this today?
What are you talking about?
Farell almost strung us up by our bollocks for losing track of you.
Okay, Skinner. Watch this.
Now I’m gonna close my eyes.
Ready?
Yeah.
[SKINNER GRUNTING]
SKINNER: Sneaky bastard.
I didn’t mind the extra push-ups.
[ALARM WAILING]
FARELL: It’s a new day people.
Destiny calls.
The world expects only one thing from us: that we will win.
WOMAN [ON TV]: …current situation on the front line.
Our troops have suffered heavy casualties.
MAN 1: It’s about time we showed those things what we’re made of.
My father flew in the Battle of Britain.
Three years before the Yanks came into the war.
Couldn’t be broken.
Backbone.
MAN 2: My Uncle George landed on the beach at Normandy.
MAN 1: Yeah?
MAN 2: In their day, this war would have been over by now.
What do they want with us, anyway?
It’s obvious, isn’t it? Minerals.
Minerals?
Yeah, minerals. Metals.
MAN 3: Oxygen, they want.
MAN 1: Oxygen?
MAN 3: Think about it.
What difference does it make?
They’re here. They’re winning.
And whatever it is, they’re gonna get it.
MAN 4: Shouldn’t you be over there?
I’ve been over there.
More times than anybody.
As a matter of fact, I’m usually long dead by now.
Coward.
MAN 5: What’s going on?
MAN 6: The power’s gone.
[SIRENS WAILING]
[PEOPLE SCREAMING]
[GUNFIRE]
[GRUNTING]
CARTER: I found the Omega.
I found it. It has to be here. Curnera Dam, Germany.
This has got to be it. It fits the description.
CAGE: You found it.
Again.
What difference does it make?
Because we’re never gonna get there.
No matter what we do…
no matter how carefully we plan…
we can’t get off that beach.
You can do this. You can.
You keep coming here every day and I’ll train you.
You already have.
I’m waiting, Nance!
Five hundred meters and closing fast!
What the…?
[GRUNTING]
COMPUTER: Reload.
What’s next?
Straight shot up the hill.
RITA: Okay.
Hey, sarge, the new guy…
what’s his name again?
CAGE: We’ll need a vehicle to get further inland.
What’s the problem?
The ambush waiting for us. They kill us before we find a working car.
Okay. So, what’s the current plan?
Two cars we haven’t tried yet.
The minivan and the green SUV.
Yeah. Okay.
I’ll head for the SUV, draw the mimics to me. You go for the minivan.
You get it started, just go, take off. Do not wait for me.
Okay.
Just don’t forget to disconnect the caravan before you take off.
You are going to be in a hurry, you don’t want any dead weight.
[ENGINE SPUTTERING]
Come on.
[ENGINE STARTS]
Come on, Cage!
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]: …casualties. The enemy has breached security at Dover.
Can’t see.
Can you?
WOMAN: Stay where you are and remain calm.
If you are in a vehicle please lock doors and stay inside.
I’m sorry. The enemy has reached London.
Repeat:
London is under attack.
Good driving.
I forgot to unhook the trailer.
COMPUTER: Engage.
You don’t talk much.
I’m not a fan.
Of talking?
Not a fan of talking. No.
You know you eventually do talk to me.
It’s usually around Lyons.
You tell me about the time you went there with your family.
Your brother got lost.
I’ve never been to Lyons.
You tell me your middle name.
Peyton.
That’s not my middle name.
You find your brother in the arcade, by the way.
RITA: Well, maybe I made it all up just to keep you quiet.
CAGE: But you do talk to me.
RITA: Cage, I do not need to get to know you.
If you knew what was good for you, you wouldn’t want to get to know me.
It’s the only way you make it through this thing.
What about Hendricks? You get to know him?
How do you know that name?
You mentioned him.
That’s not possible.
Then how do I know his name?
When did I mention him? Under what circumstance?
Is he why you won’t talk to me?
Don’t ever mention his name again.
Why? Are you… in love with him?
He’s dead.
And I watched him die 300 times and I remember every detail.
I remember everything. So I don’t need to talk about it.
I’m sorry.
It’s just war.
[BEEPING]
There’s nothing here. Let’s keep going.
We have to find the keys.
Let’s just siphon the gas.
Why drive when we can fly?
In that thing?
Let me guess. You’re afraid of heights.
I’m afraid of crashing.
And not at all ashamed to admit it.
You’ll be fine, Cage. You’ll learn. Oh.
What is it?
It’s nothing. I’m fine.
What is it?
It’s nothing.
Rita.
Let me see.
[RITA GROANS]
We have to find the keys to the helicopter.
I’m sure they’re around here somewhere.
You know, the heli’s full of fuel, though. I found a hose.
We’re flying, Cage.
Let’s just say we find the keys. You know?
Get that helicopter started.
We don’t have our jackets or ammunition.
It’s gonna be dark in a few hours.
Might be better off just going back to the farmhouse.
Seeing what we could salvage.
Spend the night there. Come back here in the morning.
And curl up by the fire and open a bottle of wine.
[LAUGHS]
I think we should just reset.
Whoa!
It’s a dead end. If it’s all the same to you I’m tired. I’m in pain.
I’d rather just start fresh.
Tell you what.
Take a few minutes. Coffee’s ready.
I’ll look for the keys. That’s productive.
Ten minutes.
Okay.
Then I’m killing you.
Fine.
I can’t believe you found coffee.
Thank you.
Oh.
Sugar, right?
Yeah.
Thank you.
No, hold on. Three. You like three.
There’s a shirt over there. It should be your size.
How many times have we been here?
How many times?
Where are the keys?
Where are the goddamn keys?
Okay.
You can fly it, can’t you?
No. Well, yes.
I mean, I can take off. I’m still working on my landing.
What are we still doing here?
You’re wasting time!
Rita, if you start that engine, you die.
This is as far as you go.
No matter what I do…
this is as far as you ever make it.
There’s a mimic buried 20 yards away.
It attacks when you start the engine.
Get your weapon and get in the helicopter, Cage.
There’s more in the field back there.
Only one of us ever makes it.
RITA: Get in.
Only thing we haven’t tried is you walk away. Go to the farmhouse.
There’s a cellar and there’s food.
Wait there… till I get back. You’ll be safe.
I’m a soldier. I volunteered. I’m not walking away.
You die here. Right here.
I can’t save you.
And if I go on and kill the Omega, you’re dead.
Forever.
Why does it matter what happens to me?
I wish…
I didn’t know you.
But I do.
My middle name…
is Rose.
[RUSTLING]
SERGEANT: On your feet, maggot!
FARELL: The good news is there’s hope for you, private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.
Battle is the great redeemer.
The fiery crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.
Yes?
Who said you could talk to me?
Have I got something on my face, soldier?
I’m sorry to disturb you, sergeant.
Let’s get this show on the road. I gotta suit up.
Where’s your helmet?
Never wear one. It’s a distraction.
Have you been drinking?
I need three more clips of 5.56…
eight grenades and an extra battery.
Get it.
SKINNER: Oi!
Oi, mate!
There’s something wrong with your suit.
There’s a dead guy in it.
KIMMEL: Whoo-hoo!
We made it!
Thank God, we made it!
[GUNFIRE]
Finish it!
It isn’t there.
CARTER: What do you mean?
CAGE: My guess is it never was.
They knew we were coming. They ambushed us.
The visions were a trap.
Just like Rita’s visions were a trap at Verdun.
It could have killed me, but it didn’t. It was after my blood.
So they know who you are. They…
They want their power back.
They’re gonna get it one way or another. Unless we find the Omega.
There isn’t any other way. We’re finished.
No.
We’re not finished.
I can’t get it to work.
You built a prototype at Whitehall.
CARTER: Yes, and I got fired for it, thank you very much.
What is this thing?
It’s a transponder.
Stick it into the Alpha and it taps into the wavelength connecting it to the Omega.
That’s the idea, anyway.
I can’t get it to work. Not with the equipment I have.
How do we get what you need?
That’s the thing. When I was at Whitehall, I built one.
I was even ready to test it.
When I told my superiors about it, I lost my job.
They thought he was crazy.
So we need to go to Whitehall.
CARTER: She’d be arrested 10 feet from the front door.
Psych ward, dissection, remember? Hey, hey, hey.
Aren’t you forgetting something?
The transponder requires a live Alpha to make it work.
We don’t need one. We got the next best thing.
CAGE: When the Chinese delegation comes out we pick up the pace.
This guy with the yellow armband always recognizes you…
so just keep your head down and stay to my right.
Nicely done.
Three, two, one. Go.
One…
Six, seven…
eight…
Twelve…
Fifteen. Now.
And, turn.
Okay. Keep walking. Just stare straight ahead.
MAN: Robinson.
I’ve asked not to be disturbed. This had better be critical.
CAGE: The fate of mankind.
Critical enough?
I don’t believe what I’m seeing.
I’ve had more than my share of that.
RITA: Sit down, general. Stay away from the desk.
I’d take her very seriously if I were you.
Have to hand it to you, major.
When you left this office today, I never imagined you’d be back…
let alone with my most decorated soldier.
I’m gonna tell you a story. It’s gonna sound ridiculous.
The longer I talk, the more rational it’s going to appear.
[PHONE RINGS]
Tell him you’ll call back.
Tell who?
Major General Beaumont, calling from Halifax. His plane’s just been delayed. Bad weather.
Yes.
Thank you, Beaumont. I’ll call you back.
CAGE: Tomorrow’s invasion is a slaughter.
I’m dead within minutes of landing along with every other soldier you are sending.
And that’s because the enemy knows we’re coming.
How do I know this? Before I died…
I killed a mimic, only this one was different.
It passed something on to me. In my blood.
Now I live the same day over and over again. Just like they do.
Just like Sergeant Vrataski at Verdun.
Tell your secretary everything’s fine.
Beg your pardon?
SECRETARY: Sorry, general. I thought you were alone.
It’s fine.
She typed up those orders for you to authorize.
But she left out the ones referring to the fuel dump at Greenwich.
Your name is Iris.
Your birthday is September 17th.
The general pulled some strings…
stationed your son in Australia, as far from the war as possible.
Tell the general his dinner’s been canceled. The call came in just now.
Your dinner was canceled.
You forgot the fuel dump.
Thank you, Iris.
That’ll be all.
Cage, let’s go. Come on.
CAGE: Rita.
Let me… Don’t shoot him again.
RITA: What are we doing?
Okay? Just…
General, this isn’t the first time we’ve had this conversation.
That’s because you’re stubborn.
You won’t believe me when I tell you that Dr. Carter was right.
That the enemy can manipulate time.
The invasion will fail. No matter how many bodies you throw at it.
The only way to win this war is…
by finding this power source of the mimic horde and killing it.
And the only means of finding it is in that safe right there.
No matter how many times we have this conversation…
you refuse to accept that the enemy breaks through to London tomorrow…
and we lose. We lose everything.
Let’s say for one moment…
that I can’t rationally explain…
your impressive parlor tricks.
Dr. Carter told me…
this device requires a live mimic to work. What use is it to you?
That’s my concern.
BRIGHAM: On the contrary.
According to you, this concerns the whole world.
Well, what would you do if you believed everything I just told you?
I would locate this…
Omega.
Bomb it out of existence.
You’re not mentally equipped to fight this thing. And you never will be.
What do we do now?
I don’t know. We’ve never gotten this far.
That was easy.
SOLDIER 1: Down!
SOLDIER 2: Stop right there! Don’t move!
SOLDIER 3: Nobody move!
SOLDIER 4: Weapon!
Stop!
They’re off and away!
They’re…
What am I supposed to do with this?
Stick it in your leg. Do it!
[CAGE YELLS]
RITA: Cage, what’s happening?
Talk to me.
CAGE: I feel it. It’s taking me there.
RITA: What do you see?
CAGE: It’s the Louvre.
RITA: Where? Where are you?
CAGE: I’m inside now. It’s flooded.
Now I’m going down. I’m in a garage. A garage underneath the museum.
RITA: The Omega. Can you see it?
It’s in Paris.
Rita!
[ALARM CHIMING]
MAN 1: Stay in the car!
MAN 2: Stay back.
MAN 1: Move away. Move away.
[MONITOR BEEPING]
[MONITOR BEEPING FASTER]
CAGE: What have you done?
What have you done?
NURSE: You’ll be fine. You just needed blood.
You don’t know what you’ve just done.
NURSE: I can’t talk to you.
I was with someone.
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?
Rita Vrataski.
Please.
Just tell me that.
Please tell me.
NURSE: I’m sorry.
[DOOR OPENS]
[ALARM WAILING]
RITA: I was out of those things in three minutes flat. What’s wrong with you?
I thought you were dead.
Not yet.
Sorry, Cage.
No! Whoa. Wait! Wait!
I’m out. I’m out. They gave me blood.
I lost the power.
I feel it.
I can’t reset the day anymore.
We have to kill the Omega before the invasion starts.
That gives us less than three hours.
We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time.
Need more soldiers too.
Now, who’s crazy enough to follow us to Paris?
Cage!
Cage!
CAGE: Guys!
We’ve been looking everywhere for you.
CAGE: Just listen.
Farell almost strung us up…
…for losing track of you.
I know. Just listen.
You’re gonna wanna hear this.
It’s gonna sound ridiculous at first.
The longer I talk, the more rational it’s going to appear.
Yeah?
He named the school I went to.
And then he tells me my second grade teacher was called Miss Polio.
She wouldn’t let him go to the bathroom made him wet his pants.
Shut up.
Look, I am telling you, man.
He knows everything.
About all of us.
Bullshit.
Yeah?
He says your name ain’t really Ford.
Says Ford was your friend.
Died in combat on his first day.
You took his place. Send your checks to his family.
You slippery bitch.
SKINNER: Cage says the enemy knows us too. They’re waiting for us on the beach.
And we all die.
The whole invasion is a slaughter.
Well, this is great.
Really good confidence boost for tomorrow. Thanks.
But we can change it, right?
There has to be something that we can do.
There has to be a way that we can win.
There is a chance. It’s a slim one.
But it means coming with me right now.
GRIFF: Listen, pal.
I don’t really care what you think you know about us.
We just met you.
Why follow him into combat?
I don’t expect you to follow me.
I expect you to follow her.
That’s the Full Metal Bitch.
CAGE: J Squad.
This is Rita Vrataski.
Otherwise known as…
KUNTZ: Yeah, yeah.
The Angel of Verdun.
Okay.
FARELL: It’s a new day, people.
Destiny calls.
The world expects only one thing from us: that we will win.
Rest assured the enemy will thank you for not giving 100 percent today.
Squad?
Where’s J Squad?
Right, okay. So this Omega, it controls time.
Just blow the New Age bollocks back where it came from.
And then we go home.
Right, it’s guarded by an Alpha.
KUNTZ: Just kill it.
Okay?
No!
You heard what Cage said.
Do not kill an Alpha.
If we do, the Omega will reset this whole day.
We’ll never remember we had this conversation.
They’re gonna know we’re coming.
What am I supposed to do if an Alpha is about to kill me?
You take a hit for the team.
When we’re on the ground…
there’s not gonna be a lot of time before they know we’re there.
We’re gonna need eyes up here.
I’m going in, Cage.
Thirty seconds till contact.
GRIFF: Cage!
Kimmel! No!
[YELLS]
Ford!
Let’s go!
Cage!
Talk to me, Rita! We gotta go.
CAGE: Drop.
Cage, they know we’re coming, man!
Drop! Drop!
Drop!
Drop.
You’re not hooked in.
What took you so long?
Any others?
SKINNER: We’re low on ammo.
I’ve got one Claymore. Ford, you’re out.
Griff has only got half a magazine and he can hardly move.
I thought you could see the future.
I haven’t lived this day.
I don’t know what’s gonna happen.
RITA: It doesn’t matter.
What matters is we finish this.
FORD: With What?
I mean, Griff can’t even walk. We’re three men down.
Come on.
RITA: We’re running out of time.
Collect your ammo.
SKINNER: Must be a thousand mimics between us and the pyramid.
What we gonna do? Walk up to the front door?
If we stay here, we die.
SKINNER: Yeah?
We’ll never get through.
We could.
In that.
That ship will never fly.
Doesn’t need to fly.
It just needs to get us across there with speed.
If the engines are still running, we could steer it with the power levers.
Skinner. Clear a path.
[YELLING]
RITA: Try it again, now.
No, it’s not reading.
Condition lever, low.
Master power, on.
Griff!
We’ve gotta go! Come on!
GRIFF: I’m not gonna be any good in there, mate.
Let me buy you some time.
CAGE: Power’s on.
This is gonna work.
FORD: Hey!
Hey, come on, man! We gotta go!
Don’t wait for us!
Skinner!
Griff, come on!
We’re good to go. Where are they?
Where’s Skinner and Griff?
They’re not coming.
GRIFF: Go, brother. You gotta go, man.
I’ll see you in the next life.
Bollocks.
Move over! Move over!
We gotta go!
Yo, we gotta go now!
They’re coming, Cage.
Come on, you bastards! Come on!
COMPUTER: Reload.
Reload. Reload.
We got incoming!
Come on!
RITA: Cage!
You have to take over!
Rita!
Punch it! Punch it!
[GRUNTS]
We’ve been through worse.
Okay.
CAGE: It’s there.
In the water. There.
RITA: That’s an Alpha.
I’m gonna draw that thing away.
You kill the Omega.
No. You won’t make it 10 feet before that thing kills you, Cage.
I can do it.
Take the grenades.
I can do it.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Neither one of us is getting out of here.
Thank you…
for getting me this far.
You’re a good man, Cage.
I wish I had the chance to know you better.
[GASPS]
[BELL RINGING]
MONTGOMERY: Welcome to London, major.
I’m Corporal Montgomery your liaison to General Brigham’s press office.
Very good to have you.
Have you heard the news? Isn’t it brilliant?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
BRIGHAM [ON TV]: Just before sunrise this morning…
a large surge of energy was detected in Paris.
We do not know exactly what this signifies.
But the result appears to be a total collapse of the enemy’s capacity to fight.
Russian and Chinese troops are now moving across Europe without resistance.
Tomorrow, we advance on the western front.
We believe we are marching to claim victory for ourselves…
for our loved ones, for our countrymen for the entire human race.
FARELL: What are you? Sound off!
ALL: I’m a warrior!
What do warriors do?
ALL: Kill!
What are you gonna do?
ALL: Kill!
You have not been in 20 battles.
I have too.
You’re gonna dump your load the second you hit the beach.
How about you two go get yourselves a nice hot cup of shut-the-hell-up!
Ha-ha. You funny, girl.
I bet you I set some kind of record tomorrow.
Fastest time running backwards, Ford, slipping in your own shit.
Knock off the grab-ass!
What are you? Sound off!
ALL: I’m a warrior!
FARELL: What do warriors do?
ALL: Kill!
Attention!
Yes?
What do you want?
